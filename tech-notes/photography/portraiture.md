# Notes on portraiture

# Composition

Composition is about arranging elements in your picture such that they are comfortable / harmonious to look at.

Symmetry, rule of thirds, etc, are ways to serve this goal of emphasizing the subject.

### Focal element

* Have a resting point for the eyes in your picture: something that a viewer is drawn to immediately.
* Elements that draw our eyes
  * Leading lines
  * Frame: look for frames and be flexible in your frames, they don't have to be rectangular, tree branches, a bridge, a shoreline can all serve as a frame
  * Geometric shapes: squares, circles
  * Vignette / darkened cornered
  * Human / animal face
  * Repetition
* Ways to emphasize your subject
  * Size
  * Color (hue cold-warm, saturation, luminance)
  * Blur (DoF, motion)
  * High contrast between the background and the subject
* Use these techniques on subjects, and avoid these on the background.

(Also refer to the notes in sdp)

### Structure

### Balance

### Common problems to avoid

* Cut-off. Cutting off one's limbs / joints can be unideal, in that our eyes expect to see the parts cut off, and having them cut off would then be a distraction to portraying the subject.
* Distracting background. In addition to being overly colorful, an unideal background could have trees / other objects with low contrast from your subject sprout from the subject's head. Observe the background, and move as needed.
* Foreground distortion. Due to perspective distortion and foreground being closer to your lens, it may appear abnormally large. (Character's nose when shooting face, feet when shooting a subject lying towards you, etc). Try changing angle / lens.
