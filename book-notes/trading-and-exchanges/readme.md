# Trading and Exchanges

On microstructure.

Trading is search problem where buyers find the best sellers and vice versa.
Trading is a 0-sum game.

### Players

* **Dealers** trade with their clients when their clients want to trade, and hope to exit the position / buy low sell high to make a profit. They take client's trading problems to their own hands, and make a profit off of them.
* **Brokers** help their clients to find counterparties to trade, and charges a commission.
* **Informed speculators** trades on predicted future prices, and make money off of dealers (price moves against them after dealer gets into a position).

Dealers make more by widening bid-ask spread, which in turn hurts uninformed traders. Uninformed traders thus lose to informed traders through dealers.

On the buy side, **investors** trade to move money from present to the future, **borrowers** do the opposite, **hedgers** trade to manage risk, **asset exchanges** trade one asset for another they value more, gamblers trade for fun.

Sell side (selling a service) of the trading industry includes dealers and brokers who provide exchange services to the buy side.

The sell side exists only because the buy side will pay for its services.

Markets are where traders get together, and the attraction of traders to other traders makes it hard to start new markets.
New markets are created when existing ones don't meet the needs of a significant subset of traders.

**Exchanges** used to be owned by member firms, and only members firms are allowed to trade there. Non-members trade via the services of a member. Recently more exchanges became corporate-owned / de-mutualized.

In many markets, dealers and brokers arrange trades **over the counter**. Corporate bond market is an example where almost all trades are OTC and not on organized exchanges.

After a trade, buyer and seller both record who they've traded with and for how much.
Both records are sent to a **clearing agency** to match up. National Securities Clearing Corporation in the US is the largest clearing agency. In cases where two records don't line up, the clearing agency asks both sides to reconcile.

**Settlement agency** receives cash from buyers and securities from sellers, when both sides have performed, they deliver cash to sellers and securities to buyers. The NSCC is also the largest settlement agency. Settlement agency nets securities and cash going to each account.
Normally US securities settle on T+3.

Derivatives have **clearing houses** settle and clear the trades, they act as a mutual insurance company. Exchanges do not allow members to trade without approval from clearing houses.

Systems that automate clearing and settling is said to be straight-through processing.

Trading instruments include real assets, financial assets, derivative contracts, insurance contracts, gambling contracts and hybrid instruments.
**Issuers** issue these instruments (they create and sell them first on primary markets, and subsequent trades appear on secondary markets).

Traders say that primary trading in new equity issues takes place in the IPO market.

**Issuers** use the services of **underwriters** to help them sell their securities, who are broker-dealers at investment banks who find buyers for the securities.
* In best-effort offering, underwriters act strictly as brokers.
* In underwritten offering, underwriter guarantees the issuer a price, and if unable to find buyers, the underwriter buys them for its own account.
* In a fixed-price offering, underwrite sets a price and buyers subscribe to the offering. In case of oversubscription, a lottery decides which buyers get the instrument.

Commodities and currencies trade for immediate delivery in spot markets, and for future delivery in forward / futures markets.

**Arbitrageurs** ensure prices don't vary much across markets. They connect sellers in cheaper markets to buyers in more expensive markets.

Markets work best when they trade **fungible instruments**, where one share of something is economically indistinguishable from all other units.

### Key themes

Information assymmetry. Well informed traders profit at the expense of less informed traders.

The option to trade is valuable. People who write limit orders give free trading options to other traders.

Order flow externaliity, positive externality is when people do something that benefits others without compensation, and negative externality is when people do something that hurts others without penalty.

Market structure consists of trading rules, physical layout, information communication system of a market. It affects strategies in that it determines what traders can do and know.

Trading strategies that generates large profits attracts new traders, whose entry brings down the profits everyone makes on average. Conversely, traders exit from unprofitable strategies, thus driving up the average profitability of everyone on that strategy.

IT has changed, and will continue changing, how people trade.

Markets for similar instruments are closely related and they often compete with each other for order flow. Order flow externaliity generally ensures for one set of closely related instruments, one set of markets will dominate over the others.

Principal-agent problems. This arises when agents do what they want to do rather than what their principals want them to do, e.g. when brokers don't work as hard on your behalf as you expect them to.

Trustworthy is when people try to do what they say they will do, and creditworthy is when people can do what they say they will do. Mechanisms to ensure people settle their trades attempts to solve the trustworthiness and creditworthiness problems, which explains much of structure of market institutions.

### An example

An instrument, e.g. ATT stock, is primarily traded at NYSE, but when a broker receives orders from its client to trade, it may not route the order to NYSE, it can, e.g. go to a regional exchange or a NASD dealer.
Where the broker routes the order can depend on prices, as well as incentives dealers offer to brokers for their order flow.

Say the order is routed to NYSE, then a specialist representing a member firm of NYSE will attempt to match the order with the best from opposite side: if it's a limit day order and no one on the opposite side is interested, it goes on the book.
If it's a market order, the specialist conducts an auction to find the trader willing to fill this at the lowest price (a trader on the floor, a resting order on the book, or the specialist's own order). If no one wants to fill that market order, the specialist himself will fill it by trading some of his own shares.

Say the order is filled, the exchange then reports the trade to Consolidated Trade Reporting System, which reports trade prices and sizes to various data vendors, who then distributes such info across the world.
