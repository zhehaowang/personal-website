# Addressing self

### Preface

Looking back, often enough the recurring feelings of deja vu convinced me of being trapped in a labyrinth, making few and arduous discovery, progress or realization.

Perhaps such is the nature of how seemingly new ideas are developed: they all trace back to something.
Yet one does not have to enter the labyrinth empty-handed, and this journal intends to equip our thoughts with Ariadne's thread, in an attempt to jot down the dots, through the connection of which we derive our core values and principles.

### The rational, moral and aesthetic nature

What kind of being am I?

Rational in its recognition of logic and reasoning, its self reflection beyond the shrouds of vanity, and its readiness to hypothesize, experiment, prove or disprove, and reiterate.
Moral in its firm judgment for what is right for oneself, the ethics by which one should live, and the commitment to the exercise of such principles.
Aesthetic in its pursuit of the creation of the good and the beautiful.

What then are our core pursuits, and what principles do we intend to uphold?

### The pursuit of knowledge

What does it mean to know something, and among all the arts in this world, what is worth knowing?

Most of my time was spent as a student, but among the things I was taught, I cannot say I learnt most of them.
One can read a book, audit a course, labor in pratices, while all of these are ways of obtaining knowledge, they can be irrelevant when evaluating whether our goal of learning something is achieved.

I often times see these feats from those considered masters of their arts:
* To be able to explain it to a community, both from a high level and in-depth, in order to cater to different interest and skill levels of the audience.
* To be able to connect the dots when something seemingly irrelevant to the untrained eyes is brought up.
* To be able to apply what they know to produce something tangible.

Perhaps this is better phrased as to internalize something, and to grasp the underlying principles (or confluences, by the analogy of some cross-disciplinary scholars).

Our pursuit of knowledge is then characterized by the same feats.
Let us not rest in the comforts of having read something, but one step further of pondering, discussing, applying and teaching what we have read, as true tests of our internalization of such knowledge.
In the field of engineering, this can come in the forms of understanding the design alternatives, building something with it, having seminal discussions with like-minded people, and many others.
For all of which we should seek and create opportunities, if we find them lacking.

When reflecting daily what we have achieved, make sure to apply the same criteria of internalization.

### Open-mindedness

The topic of what is worth internalizing is a subjective and mercurial one.

I appreciate the beauty in most trades, be it various fields of liberal arts, sciences and engineering, skills in particular sports and interpersonal relationships.
Such diversity is what makes here an incredible place for the curious, whose efforts are fueled by the freedom to pursue these.

It is my goal to number among the curious.
To be ready and excited waking up each morn thinking about the knowledge we are going to internalize, and the challenges we are going to tackle.

To take in, think and act with an open mind, and be open and flexible to change, without losing sight of what we set out to achieve, or failing to adhere to our principles.

To reflect, strengthen what we did well, and readily acknowledge where I was wrong, and to not judge others for our differences in the perception of what is worthwhile.

### On hope and external conditions

Recent events reinforced the notion that much of my fate is not in my own hands.
As an immigrant to this country, I saw how limited my freedom is, in pursuing what I deemed worthy, due to the restrictions in switching employers and traveling abroad.

This may be a moment when I should swallow my pride, fear and anxiety, and accept it for what it is, as the serenity prayer would preach.
To live and learn is but the best option we have, and there is something to be salvaged from every misfortune, and it is through such we evaluate ourselves, steer our goals and harden our resolve.

In these endeavors, know that we do not bow to the whims of external conditions.
I hold firm the belief that one's excellence is decoupled from external conditions.

The goal is to master my own fate.
The way is through the pursuit of knowledge.
And in the pursuit I aim to stay true to the virtues below, and to weather the storms with faith and temperance.

### On compassion, gratefulness, and humility

I was gifted with a loving and supportive family.
We were not affluent in our wealth, but never lacked the means to afford food, lodging or education.
Throughout my life I was fortunate enough to learn from many whom I admire and appreciate.

Such cannot be said for many others, not for those from the poor rural area where I taught in 2011, nor even for my parents who grew up in turbulent times.
It is not due to their lack of endeavors (usually quite the opposite), but simply a factor of luck.

To such fortune and those who participated in weaving it we show gratitude.
And to cherish these that we arguably are not worthy of, we work and learn hard, and pay it forward.

Do not ridicule, or easily discredit others: it could be just a difference in habits, belief, temperament and priorities.
Most in life are burdened with their own struggles, be it career, health, relationships and many others.

Do not think that the troubles you face are the biggest adversity, or decide what few accomplishments you have deserve the attention and praise of all, or boast what little you own and realize.
Listen attentively, show compassion, be supportive, learn from them, and heartily congratulate them for their achievements.

Greed, vanity and ignorance often cloud our judgment, do not fall victim to the temptation of such.

### On canon and change

Inmobility creates stagnation, which invariably would lead to another extreme that we feared: dogmatic adherence to the canon destroys creativity, and by extension the chance of progress through change.

Although we intend to lay down the ground rules in this work, the most important of which, however, is the principle to embrace change.
What works best now offers no implication that it would work best in the days to come, and even the claim of best itself would often times have to be proven by the experience of suboptimal alternatives.

Once more, what we truly seek would a balancing ground, or even progress through compromises. To never be bound by canon, reflect on our principles, why we hold them and did we do an adequate job. Be flexible and creative in the application of such, and be ready to experiment.

### On courage and discipline (WIP)

Readily jump into actions.

Perseverance, rituals, habits.

The wisest men follow their own directions.

### On the fragility of life

Despite all our efforts, this life might not be a lengthy one.

Perhaps often enough had calamities and misfortune struck down the best and worthiest of us, that it would be naive to ease one's mind in the illusion that such are only remote possibilities.

In this regard, our hopes and courage have come to terms with the likely outcome that when time itself outruns our will, the state we are to be left in would not be a perfect one.
To this end even less room for slacking off would be offered: we have identified the worthy and the right, hopefully to the best of our current knowledge and judgment, and we are almost certain there will not be enough time to adequately pursue all of them.

What, then, is important, at what time horizon, and why?

With these in mind, what excuses could I then have, to not deprive oneself of the distractions, or to delay the pursuit of the most important?
