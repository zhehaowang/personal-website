# Language

Language is not the same as communication / imitation (the latter animals can do but the former seems unique to homo sapiens).

A gradual evolution 100k years ago.

Chomsky hypothesis: language is something we are genetically programmed with, as opposed to culture, society-specific phenomenon.
As speaking a language is not particular to certain areas but all humans do.
Also the ability to learn new languages degrade as one gets older, another characteristic of something a species is genetically programmed to do.

There are over 6000 spoken languages and over 200 written. A language can have only three verbs where they say "do a sleep"; it may use clicks (Bantu languages of Botswana and Namibia, X, C, Q pronounced with a tongue click) where having one to four clicks before a word mean different things; it may have one word that others mean in a long sentence.

### Language change over time

The writing changes slower, and the sound changes happen faster, typically in following ways:
* Assimilation, least effort to make the different sounds. Example being inpossibilis in Latin to impossibilis, as m is closer to the following p. 
* Consonant devolve: they become softer or omitted over time. Examples being Latin into French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian. The change of t and d, k and g, removal of consonant sound, etc. aqua (Latin) --> agua (Spanish) --> eau (French).
* Vowel devolve and shift over time.
The Great Vowel Shift, starting in the 13th Century, the vowels shifted "up". ah --> ay. name as nahmeh to its modern day pronouciation is a result of this shift, and devolve the last vowel.
Modern written English still reflects how the language was pronounced before the shift: oo as in food was a long ou but now an u, feed was an ae but now i.

The language we speak today also shifts, e.g. aw --> ah in some areas. They started out as accents and gradually the general populace talk in different ways.
Meaning of words, too, shift: awesome and lame in the 60s vs now.

With the sounds devolving over time a language does not become fumbling of vowels over time, as new words are constantly being created.

Some languages work with tones, others suffixes prefixes.
Tones presumably could have come from words devolved over time. Imagine "pa", "pas", "pak" meaning different things in a language, over time the consonant devolves and the only thing differentiating these would be tone.

Grammatical words and concrete words

**Grammaticalization**: over time concrete ones devolve into grammatical ones. Example being the French pas, where it used to be that ne by itself means negation, and pas had a concrete meaning of "a step", like il ne marche pas used to mean he doesn't walk a step. Over time this concrete meaning devolved and pas was appended meaning general negation with ne.
ne can be downplayed in Spoken French, imagine someone else transcribing this language they can derive the impression that pas alone means negation.

Suffixes and prefixes, and tones, too, are results of grammaticalization. Latin has different verb forms for "I speak", "you speak" and "he speaks", which is resulted from the phrase "speak I will", etc, and the I/you/he will parts were different. They were glossed over over time and the verb "speak" with different suffixes became prevalent.

Another language is "will" used to come from "sun come", in an African language.

**Rebracketing** is another common sound change, where the boundary of two words became different. "My Ellie" turned into "Nelly", "My Edward" turned into "Ned", "all one" turned into alone.

### Semantic change

Meaning change over time, too. Silly used to mean blessed, and the German root still means blessed. Silly Virgin Mary means blessed / innocent Virgin Mary in the 13th Century. Gradually it shifted to mean innocent in Shakespeare's time. Innocent is connected with needing some compassion and in our time it means not very bright. Nice use to mean fine-grained small pieces, as in nicety, but has to mean pleasant in our time.

In this way, bear (to carry a burden) shares the same root as birth (th is grammaticalization of another word, like warmth for warm), and transfer / prefer (borrowed from Latin's proto-Indo-European root of bear, fer).

Semantic narrow and widen, too. Meat used to mean all food but has specifically come to mean animal flesh. Bird used to be specific and foul was general but now the semantic of bird is widened.

### Word order change

* Modern languages have all combinations of (subject, verb, object) order.
* Both SOV and SVO are very common, historically change from SOV to SVO has been common, while the other direction has been rare.
  * Modern German, Turkish, old English, biblical Hebrew are all SOV languages, while modern English and modern Hebrew are SVO.
  * Welsh, Irish Gaelic, Polynesian languages are VSO.
  * OVS is rare, some South American native language uses it.
  * An Australian native language has no fixed order. Suffix and context differentiate subject and object.
* Language studies words, sounds, grammar and meaning change over time.

### Change

Language is constantly morphing, not for good or bad.
Some directions of change are predictable: e.g. th in English to t, f, or s.
Some semantic decay can be seen in lie/lay, infer/imply, hither/thither/whither, thou look'st/thee look, is shot/shotten, spit/spitten in modern English.
Earlier pronounciation books (recorded sound became available only in the 1870s) suggested dismay/dismiss should be pronounced dizmay/dizmiss, and balcony has emphasis on co.
Modern English says "a house is being built" while 19c English may say "a house is building"

Example of change in Latin, of the Indo-European Italic language and the origin of Romance languages.
The Roman Empire is unique in its efforts of Romanization: ancient empires, e.g. that of the Persians rarely impose that their language be the only language taught in conquered territory.

Latin uses noun suffixes to indicate object, and doesn't have to, a, the, etc. Modern Romance languages dropped these noun suffixes. 

Some common pattern of change, e.g. grass in Latin, herba, h is usually fragile in Romance language, French herbe, Spanish hierba (pronounced yierba), Italian erba, Portuguese relva, Romanian iarba.

English is proto-Germanic and has undergone lots of changes, too. Shakespeare writes in a language that is very different from what is spoken today.
Due to semantic drifts, Shakespeare translated to modern foreign languages can often be easier to understand.
E.g. wherefore meant why, not where; wit meant knowledge, not as in witticism. (humor is fragile!)

Jane Austen's language is also different from ours, e.g. "you are come at last", or "it would, would not it?" is perfectly normal in her time.

Archaic Chinese evolved as well, several branches of modern Chinese can sound like completely different languages: a few major variations in mandarin, cantonese, shangainese, fujianese, taiwanese, gan, xiang, hakka language (ke'jia'hua)

In English, present progress tense vs present habitual tense is pretty unique / nice: the "-ing" form of a verb like "I am eating" is not present in languages like French or German.

### Proto-Indo-European

Studies showed the similarity between Sanskrit, Latin and ancient Greek, non of these spoken now.
They trace back to the same ancestor, a proto-Indo-European language which is the ancestor of most languages in Europe (except Hungarian, Basque, Finnish, and a few others), Iran, and upper two-thirds of India (lower third was Dravidian language family).

This was not a written language, and its original forms can be deduced from variations in today's descendant languages (sound, and more so in grammar).

Proto-Indo-European is thought of to have started from Kurgan language of southern Russian steppes (others may claim Anatolia / Turkey), as genetic traces would suggest, as well as certain patterns and living descendants of this language tend to have common words for horse, wheels, but not oak, vine, or palm trees.

German, English (and Swedish, Norwegian, Danish) are Germanic branches of Indo-European, where from Latin some common deviations include p --> f (pater to father), t --> th, etc. This is described in Grimm's Law.

Latvian and Lithuanian, the Baltic branch of Indo-European, is thought to have undergone more conservative changes, and remain closer to the Indo-European root. (More so in Slavic languages, too)

Armenian and Albanian, although Indo-European in origin, have borrowed more from neighboring languages and fewer words in common with the other branches of Indo-European languages.

Comparative reconstruction: decuding the original form of a proto-Indo-European word from several modern day / extinct descendants.
The general methodology seems to combine the more uncommon features from later variants (some common forms of decay / patterns of change have been noted), as those, especially if appearing in multiple descendants in different geolocations, are more unlikely to be the results of coincidental change the multiple descendants all went through.

### Some peculiarities 

Semitic languages (of Afro-Asiatic language family, Hebrew, Arabic, Ethiopian, etc). Tri-consonantal root with vowel variations

Japanese, Southeast Asian languages, Chinese, numeral classifier, sounds like la ba me to help convey meaning, no distinction between he, she, it in sound, and generally more contextual than English.

### Tracing language families

Tracing the source of a language family: usually the area with the largest diversity, Austronesian languages, spoken east of Australia, Polynesian, Indonesia, Malaysia and Madagascar (!) is thus thought to have originated from Taiwan, as three of the four sub families in Austronesian have their presence in Taiwan.

Similarly, Bantu languages (Swahili, Xhosa, etc) spoken south of the Sahara are thought to have started from Cameroon and east Nigeria.

Khoisan languages (click languages) spoken in southwestern Africa may have been the descendent of the first human language, as its families are very diverse, and the raison d'etre of some features like clicks would otherwise be hard to deduce.

Native American languages are extremely diverse in regions like California and further south but not in Alaska, even though Archaeological evidence points to native Americans having migrated across the Bering Strait.
This correlates with climate change in that native Alaskans languages are those spoken by the people from down south who repopulated that area, after the ice age.

### Cases for and against proto-world

Language dates back 150k to 50k years, writing only dates back 6k, the further the deduction the more difficulty in comparative reconstruction.

The proto-world may be on to something, that there might have been one language that was the ancestor of all (or a proto-euro-asian ancestor), but so far the theory and deduction seems shaky.

Some similarities are purely by chance, e.g. in English and Japanese, while others are harder to explain, e.g. a dialect of Nepal and a Papua New Guinea language.
Often times a grammatical / structural similarity demonstrates a higher likelihood of two languages sharing the same root (than pure pronunciation coincidences.)

### Dialects

Each language is a bundle of different variants.
What became canon for a country is often times more geopolitical than intrinsic to the language itself.

Italian of the Tuscany variant, English of the London variant, French of the Ile-de-France variant became canon not because they are superior to that of Sicily, Kent, or Provencal in any way, rather from decisions of the past (e.g. nationalism, in forging a unified national identity, one particular variant is picked and standardized, that of the ruling class / with the most political / military power became canon.)

Such canon change over time, court Russian was once Ukrainian due to the power center being in Kiev, then that of Moscow and Ukranian considered a peasant dialect (USSR time), to modern times where Ukrainian is considered its own language.

Written records suggest 500 years ago it would've been really difficult for a London English speaker to understand a Kent English speaker, even though the grammar / underlying structure are very much shared, the pronunciation can be fairly different.

Similarly, those we consider different languages today sometimes sit better as variants of the same bundle: Scandinavian languages Swedish, Danish and Norwegian being quite similar to each other. Erdu and Hindi being quite similar (grammar, and sometimes vocabulary) but backed by different writing systems (Erdu uses an Arabic-like writing, Hindi uses Devanagari writing system) and considered different due to historical enmity.
Moldovan vs Romanian is similar, when Moldova was an SSR of the Soviet Union, it's tasked to come up with a Moldovan language backed by Cyrillic alphabets as opposed to Romania's Latin alphabets, but the underlying are very similar.

On the other hand, different (seven) dialects of Chinese are often as different as French / Spanish is. (Or Arabic spoken in Morocco vs in Syria)
In the Chinese and the Arabic case the writing system is the same, but pronunciation can be vastly different, and sometimes even grammar.
They are considered dialects more often due to geopolitical / nationalism reasons, than anything intrinsic to the language itself.

Dialect continuum: it's sometimes hard to decide the line between one dialect or another, as each one differs with the one next door only by a little, but looking far enough the two become distinct enough.
These then become a collection of dialect whose diversification happens on a continuous scale.

Diglossia is a condition where two languages or two variants of the same language are used in the same geolocation by the same people, usually divided into a high-low variants.
Not that the high is superior in any sense, just that having different variants spoken in different contexts is a common phenomenon.
Examples include standard Arabic as the Quran is written in, and Egyptian Arabic which is used colloquially and very different; Hochdeutsch and Swiss German; English (h) and French (l) in old Quebec; French (h) and Russian (l) in Anna Karenina; and in English itself where some words are more formal while others more colloquial but they mean the same thing: kids / children, bag / parcel, go back / return, etc.
Some states have triglossia e.g. Java Island where high, middle and low Javanese may sound very different and used in different contexts.

Diglossia is often the effect of one version of the language being written in works of great importance, and that version becomes fixed.
Uusally the H version is a historical snapshot of the language. E.g. standard Arabic being what the Quran is written in, and Egyptian and other variants of Arabic kept on changing.
Writing slows down the pace a language changes: it might be easier for us to converse with Shakespeare, than him with a person in the 11th century.
The H is not necessarily always more complicated than the L, it is so in some cases e.g. spoken French dropping ne in ne...pas, but in spoken Chinese dialects there can be more tones than Mandarin.

Writing is almost orthogonal to speaking, the former being something one goes through formal training to acquire, and the latter being more of a biological instinct.
The written language is almost always very different from the spoken one: more composition, more structure, bigger vocabulary, longer, etc. The start of Hebrew Bible may be a good example of when writing mimicing the spoken language as the former was not yet too developed. The written language in Gibbon's work, on the other hand, would demonstrate a style that is very distinct from a spoken language.
Not that either is superior in any way as both can be elegant.

English as it is today is influenced by rules people like Lowth introduced (somewhat arbitrarily), think peculiarities like "you were (was)", "aren't I (am not I)", "to whom (to who)", meaning of double negative (ain't got nothing).
Based on their notion of Latin and Greek are superior languages, any change / decay in the language is undesirable, and that grammar should always be logical.

### Borrow and mixing

Languages borrow and mix, both words and grammar.
English in particular is a bastard language in the sense that most of the vocabulary today is borrowed.
1 percent from old English, and the rest from old Norse dating back to the Viking invasions, Norman dating to William the Conqueror, and Latin / Greek dating to later when English became a language of learning.

The shorter and more widely used words often are different and rooted in old English, while the longer ones for something specific and complex are usually quite similar with French, etc.

This borrowing creates interesting effects like doublets of words and the high / low variant, e.g. beef and cow, pork and pig.

There isn't a language quite like English like the similarity between different Slavic languages or Portuguese with Spanish, the closest is probably Dutch but that's still a long way off.

Grammar, too, are borrowed.
An example being the Indo-European language like Hindi coming into contact with Dravidian language in the south and being impacted by its SOV ordering.

Code-switching of switching languages mid-sentence (following a particular set of rules) is a sign of a bilingual person with dual cultural background, and another process in which grammar of one language can be introduced into another, and new languages be born. (E.g. a language in Ecuador that is a mix of Quechua and Spanish)

How the modern education teaches languages (books on grammar, memorizing words, speaking after some teacher) is not how language has been learnt in the past.
And the learning process of hearing and repeating in the past presumably contributed to the much borrowing and mixing we see today as well.

Languages mix and borrow in a symbiotic-like fashion. The branches of a bush mix and form a net.

Language areas, where languages of different family draw features from each other and became closer in terms of grammar and words. Examples being Bulkan area where Romanian is of Romance sub-family of Indo-European, Albanian of Albanian sub-family, and Bulgarian of Slavic sub-family, yet Romanian adopted having the/a behind the noun unlike other Romance languages but like Albanian, and Bulgarian got the/a in the first place which is unlike other Slavic languages.

Another area is Sino-sphere where Tai-Kadai (Laotian and Thai), Austro-Asiatic drew from Sino-Tibetan.

### Complexities in languages

Languages develop complexities that are not quite necessary for being able to clearly express.
E.g. has done perfect tense in English (event happened in the past having impact on current, a peculiar feature to mostly European languages), gender (masculine and feminine) forms, factual marker (needing to differentiate a fact you see, heard or hearsay with an ending to the word) etc.
Such usually comes from grammaticalization.

There is no defined standard what is needed to clearly express in a language, but each language picks up a few features such as tones, endings, factual markers, tenses, etc.

All languages are complex but not equally so.
The case usually is that the more secluded the language, the more complicated it gets.
An example being Tsez, a language spoken by tens of thousands in the Caucasus, where the sound involves waggling the back of your throat, has four genders, (on verb and adjectives when they don't start with a consonant) 

Children has amazing imitation skills in picking up these complexities in languages, and beyond a certain point such a language would be very difficult to learn.

Languages simplify due to external influence, e.g. a particular group of adults learning the language.
Real Javanese was formed around the time of different ethnic groups coming to learn the language, as was Mandarin Chinese which was deemed simpler than Chinese dialects for its reduced variants in tones and possible consonant endings.
Mandarin came around a time when groups of Tibetans, Mongolians, etc adults came to northern China to learn the language.
The Mandarin simplification was not as extreme as that of Real Javanese.

### Proto-Germanic and English

German, English, Dutch, Faroese and Frisian are derived from proto-Germanic family.
One of the characteristics of this family, compared with other branches of Indo-European, is its emphasis is usually on the first syllable, making endings particularly vulnerable to being dropped.
Modern English keep very few case endings, including 's' and more commonly used ones like "him", "whom", etc.

Proto-Germanic traces two thirds of its words back to proto-Indo-European, and the other third is unknown, including words like "sheep".
One theory attributes the rest to Semitic influence. There were records of Semitic speaking sailors in Northern Europe.
Some similarity in words exist, and sometimes the verb transformation reflects the tri-consonantal root with vowel variations seen in Semitic languages (e.g. think - thought).
Grim's law could also be related with Semitic influence.

Old English is much like German, also being SOV, the change from old English likely was due to invasion of old Norse speakers.
They settled in, learnt the language half-heartedly and following a learning methodology very different from today's, and resulted in changes (simplifications) in the English grammar.

### Language and culture / psycology of a people

Suppear-Warf hypothesis claims grammar channels the way people think.
This is luring but unproven.
The current belief is that language is largely not indexed to culture, and its transformation is unconnected with culture.

Warf's example was standard average European language (Germanic, Romance languages) vs native American language Hopi.
The latter has one word for all flying objects except birds, differentiates water you use and water you see, doesn't have tense which supposedly reflects native American's cyclical view of time.

The theory largely thought the likes of English being crude and Hopi sophisticated, the typical trend in linguistic study of his time.

Examples for the theory includes empirical observations but not proofs. Honorific distinctions in Japanese, Korean, reflecting the respect hierarchies in these cultures.
Also more often than not French speakers think of tables as female in cartoons due to gender markers in the language.
Speakers of a language that does not differentiate blue/green (glu) seem to take more effort differentiating these two colors, and those who have two yellows take less effort to differentiate different yellows.

Problems with the hypothesis include Warf being wrong about Hopi whose view of time is not cyclical but record-based and the language does have some time markers.
And counter examples include inalienable possessive marking usually not found in languages spoken by the capitalist world but rather those in the Amazon jungles.
Another being fly, crawl, float are all move with different particles as opposed to their own words in Navajo, a traditionally nomadic people.

Navajo differentiates handling of objects depending on the shape and form of something, this fact did not seem to make the speakers more likely to differentiate objects by form and shape as opposed to color and size. Something else does.

The theory of languages reflecting culture has never been proven.

### Pidgin

A particular group of people learning a language to get by, also resulting in a much simplified combination of the two languages.

Them making systematic mistakes which evolved into implicit rules in the bastard version of the language.

This includes Cantonese traders speaking English (where Pidgin came from), 18th Century native American English, a Russo-Norsk language spoken by Russian traders spending their summers in Norway.

The Russo-Norsk language in particular has no markings, verb conjugations, one preposition, no gender, very simple pronunciation, 300 words with a few for different alcohol.

### Creoles

Every language traces back to something and Creoles are instances where new language gets created from pidgins.
Note that Creole doesn't specifically refer to Creoles of European and native American origins.

When pidgin speakers do not go home and keep speaking their pidgins, over time due to the need to express themself in nuanced ways a language gets built back up from stripped down versions that is a pidgin (having a full language is part of being human).

Example include Tokpissen (business talk) in Papua New Guinea, its Lingua Franca.
British South Sea plantation brought over population from New Guinea and this language is developed, propagated back to the islands, and became a way people from different islands speaking different aberiginal languages can communicate.

Lousiana French Creole, Haitian English Creole, Guyana English Creole, West African and (dying) Indian Portuguese Creole, Uganda Arabic Creoles are all examples of such.

Most Creoles are created from colonization and slave trade.

They differ from dialects of the language in that the grammar and how the vocabulary are used are different enough that listeners to a Creole cannot tell what the original language was and how it evolved to the point of the Creole.

Saramarkan Creole in Suriname (Carribean Creole resulted from slave trade) has a hybrid European vocabulary.
Slaves on the planatation (run by the English then the Dutch, with a mix of Portuguese Jews fleeing the inquisition and an Angola (West Africa) influence) developed this language.
It developed simple tones (something no pidgins have), a particular grammar that involves different forms of "to be" and nuances that are hardly necessary for conveying meaning unambiguously, and a marker indicating something fallen / being thrown finishing its trajectory.

Hawaiin English Creole has a grammar that developed from the Chinese, Japanese and Phillipino planatation worker pidgin.

Bio-programme hypothesis: Bickerton claims if there is a universal grammar, Creole languages would reflect this grammar without all the complexities of a traditional language developed over time (almost all of which has, e.g. either tones or prefixes / suffixes).
This is again controversial.

Creoles are often times more streamlined than traditional languages that developed (maybe accidental) gunks over time, and could reflect what a language needs, or even the first language, if there was one.

Creole is a continuum concept (as languages and dialects), there is the language that gave it its words, a deepest Creole, and many variants in between.
Afrikaans is e.g. more streamlined than Dutch (e.g. no gender), but not a full Creole.

### Black English

A dialect of English, not any bastardization, nor a Creole or an African language.

Slangs are just the icing, it's also a unique sound system (th and f) and grammar (dropping "to be", "be" being a habitual marker not a present marker).
