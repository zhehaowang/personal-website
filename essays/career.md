# Bloomberg 2017 - 2018

The coming week marks the end of my first job as a full-time software engineer, working with Bloomberg LP.

In the last year and a half I was gifted with the opportunity to work in an incredible environment with many talented people, for which I remain grateful.
I was fortunate enough to have forged a bond with a few among them, hopefully one that will last beyond my now limited days in the company.

### The decision

Before transitioning from a student researcher to a professional engineer, I did not picture myself looking for new opportunities, or quitting a job in the first two years.

I knew there would be problems, and chores that I dislike, but as engineers we are hired to deal with them, and in doing so we develop our core skill set, namely that of problem solving.

It may sound hypocritical to claim that I still hold such beliefs, despite deciding to leave instead of seeing it through, all within two years.

There are, however, a plethora of factors behind each decision, and I hope to justify mine from these ones below.

##### Growth

As a junior engineer growing one's skill set is the top-most concern.

There is a tactical and a strategic perspective to most of our problems.
The tactician in us identifies the best approach to the battle at hand, while the strategist looks ahead and behind, carefully planning the next campaign, making sure it's fought at the right time and place so that we could reap the heftiest benefits.

The strategist surveyed the battleground, and became doubtful of its outlook.

In seeking growth we strive for the areas in which we want to grow to line up with our efforts at work.
Yet most of the time we found the work so focused in the mundane that we doubt if anything we gain is of strategic value, i.e. transferrable skills.

Coupling that with legacy frameworks inherited from a long past (by software engineering standards), the outlook dims further.

Legacy systems aren't necessarily evil, and everything has its lifetime.
We were rightfully taught to be skeptical about the new and shiny technologies, and to focus on grasping the fundamentals.

A system infested with questionable practices, out-of-date design decisions, and friction in iterability may make a great proving ground for a skilled veteran, and I'd be delusional to consider myself one such.

It's comforting that the company is actively looking to address many of these, but it takes time to overcome such inertia.

##### Seeking change

Being curious is mentioned as a highly desirable trait in software engineers by many sources.

Seeing the woes of our development today, sometimes I can't help but wonder how others do it differently.
What could be better than to experience the difference firsthand?
Without seeing the contrast, it's difficult to appreciate what we enjoy here.

Over the years I saw myself becoming accustomed to bad practices, and getting satisfied from just getting by.
This state of stagnancy would be my worst fear: settling for the sub-optimal and knowing only the superficial.

The environment assimilates us: it lures us to its comforts, dulls our senses and weakens our resolve.

I am aware the young are often criticized for their lack of perseverance in pursuing one goal for a prolonged period of time.
I myself may very well be subject to this blame.

On the other hand we live but once the twenty-fifth year of our lives, perhaps the best period to expand our horizons and embrace change.

### Going forward

From my under-sampled observation, quite a few who left are considered the best and brightest among us.
I admire the dedication and loyalty, as well as the talent of those who stayed.
Nor dare I number myself among the ranks of the best and brightest.

Now that we are given an opportunity to start afresh at a place well regarded by some, I hope we make sure to treasure such.

A few areas we hope to do better in:
* Proactivity
* Deliver
* Critical path and prioritization
* Advocate for yourself, sell, and speaking up
