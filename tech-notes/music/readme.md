# Western music

Music as a mirror (think Beethoven's 2nd composed at the lowest of his lows, and bowel movement).

Western music. Constant change of style, role and identity of the composer, change of the subjects of our expression, and pace of change proportional to that of the society.

Social / cultural / religious traditions. The piece itself. Vocabulary (Conjunctive, disjunctive.)

### Greek Roman and early Christian

From 4000BC to 0AD, about 40 fragments of pieces of music (oral tradition, sometimes preserved on paper, e.g. an excerpt from Euripides' Orestes was found on a papyrus two hundred years after it was composed; the 1st Century AD Roman drinking song Seikilos epitaph, "don't worry, be happy") survived.

The humanistic musical ideals of the Greek, much like that of ours today.
The doctrine of ethos. Pythagoras. The mathematical ratios that governed the cosmos.

Monophonic. The instrument Cithara, a seven-string lyre.

The creators of opera in renaissance were convinced they were recreating Greek comedies / tragedies.

Musical corollary of the early church.
* Music for divine beauty.
* Music is a servant of religion. Strictly instrumental must be rejected. 
* Dancing is associated with Pagan traditions and must be rejected.

And the Greek humanistic tradition is lost.

### Medieval

##### Dark ages (~600 - ~1000)

Plain chant / Gregorian (Pope 590 - 604) chant.
* Hymns. Calm. Conducive to meditation and quietude. Smooth, conjunct, no regular beat, monophonic. Anonymous authors
* Mass

##### High medieval (~1000 - ~1400)

Improvement in public safety. Cities. Development in architecture, agricultural technology and secular courts.

Polyphony music. Two individual melodies at the same time.
With it comes the necessity for a musical notation, and soon came the identity of the composer, and music sets out on the path of being self-expressive.

First form, organum.
One melody to praise God, another of man to echo that of the God.

Florid (flowery) organum.
Old arts of the Notre-Dame school. Characteristics
* Stretched (long sustained tenor voice). Melisma (single word over multiple notes).
* Organ in the background.
* Hand of God.

##### 14th Century

Time of change.
Babylonian captivity. The Great Schism. The Black Death.

New arts of Notre-Dame school.
* Secular subjects. Isorhythmic (Pitch and rhythms are designed separately. Think multiple vocal tracks of multiple poems simultaneously). Structural complexity.

### Renaissance

Lost faith in church, classicism, trying to achieve what the Greeks once did in their music: expressive and being moved by their composition.

Emphasis on
* Articulation of words
* Music reflecting on the meaning of words
* Secular, humanistic subjects

This led to the rejection of melismatic, ornamental organum (one word over multple notes hurts articulation), as well as isorhythmic pattern from the last century.

Reinspection of Pythagoras's work on consonant and dissonant notes (notes that blend well vs not).
Harmony and tuning system.

(Pythagoras: pitch produced by a string of length 6 is an octave lower than the pitch produced by a string of length 3. The distance between pitch of length 3 is a "perfect 5th" away from pitch of length 2. The theory on harmonic series.)

A cappella: as in the chapel (without instrumental accompanying)

Major triads were explored during the Renaissance, the notes are conjunct.

The words are articulate but multiple voices are overlapping.
Machaut, Mass de Notre Dame.

Polyphony.

### Renaissance - mass

Mass got its name from missa in Latin "Ite, missa est" (the concluding act to dismiss the congregation).

The high mass has two major sections
* The liturgy of words
* The liturgy of eucharist (Greek for giving thanks)
and 17 (or more, depending on categorization) parts.

Two categories of activities:
* The proper, where texts differ from mass to mass
* The ordinary, where texts do not change

Renaissance composer had the choice to compose for the former or the latter, and they chose the latter.

Parts in the second category include Kyrie, Gloria, Credo (in the liturgy of words), and Sanctus (divine), Agnus Dei (lamb of God), ite missa est (in liturgy of the eucharist).

High Renaissance composers unified the ordinary of a mass with a plain chart, featuring harmonic triads on the more conjunctive end.
Its form either
* Fixed melody mass (tenor mass), where an existing plain chant is used as-is as one track
* Paraphrase mass, where the plain chant was changed from being modal to more tonal. Josquin is master at this.
* Imitation mass, where any melody instead a of plain chant can do.

16th Century Catholic church was originally tolerant towards the last form of mass, until Martin Luther and the Reformation, his 95 theses targetting the church.
Council of Trent and the Counter Reformation lowered the tolerance for such, and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina's masses where the words are clearly distinguishable became acceptable to the church.
