# Sapiens

### Cognitive revolution

What separates homo sapiens from homo erectus, or neanderthal? The former is the predominant human race, while the DNA of the latter can hardly be traced to modern human beings. (some neanderthal DNAs were able to be found to modern day human beings)

Homo sapiens were hunter gatherers / foragers.
Ache society in Paraguay are hunter gatherers living to this day, with the tradition of killing off the old and the infants who can't keep up with the tribe. Yet do we live in a happier society than them?

The cognitive revolution saw homo sapiens' brains being able to process something purely fictional, like laws, or the United States of America.
This power to process something imaginary lets us grasp far more things than what's encoded in our DNA.
The course of natural evolution runs much slower than that of our cognitive revolution.
In turn, such understandings are not preserved by the species: it's not in our DNA, rather, it dies as the individual bearing it dies.

Cognitive revolution allows homo sapiens to band together in much larger numbers under shared myths, e.g. that of religion or nationalism, and collaborate in ways far more flexible than what's encoded in our DNA.

### Agricultural revolution

Did homo sapiens domesticate the wheat, or did wheat domesticate homo sapiens?
Our bone structures were not evolved naturally to take care of wheat, nor our lifestyle.

Is the success of a species to be judged by the average of individual happiness, or by how many replicas of its DNA it was able to reproduce?
Homo sapiens, especially after the agricultural revolution, are hugely successful in terms of the latter, but may be questionable in terms of the former.
There is no going back in the agricultural revolution.

The collective myths. Objective, subjective, inter-subjective. Something prevalent in the minds of a multitude of subjects does not make it objective.
The myth of modern time could be considered as that of consumerism and romanticism: broadening our horizon via consuming different kinds of experiences. E.g., that of traveling abroad.

An Egyptian noble would probably not consider travelling to Babylon with his wife a desirable form of entertainment, they'd much rather be building an expensive tomb, perhaps.

Summerian writing. Catalogging. A scribe system.

### Scientific revolution

We know that we don't know.
Falsifiability.
Monarchs, social elites, and the like believe in the benefits of technological advancement and find their investment in such worthwhile. 

* Imperialism, an amalgam of different cultures and without clear definition of borders. (Think Athenian, Roman, British empires)
* Capitalism, whereas those before Adam Smith would have us believe the economy pie is limited in size and an increase of my share comes at a cost of decreasing those of others', capitalism would have us believe the pie grows by reinvesting earnings into growth. By encouraging consumption and (re)investment the economy grows.
* Humanism, that of the liberal (individuality), socialism (collectivism), and evolutionary (facism) branches.

Religion
* Animism
* Polytheism is generally acceptive to foreign beliefs / deities, e.g. the Romans didn't mind adding the Egyptian Isis to their Pantheon. What about Roman prosecution of Christianity? It was mostly a half-hearted effort, and early Christianity sometimes come with political insurgence. Polytheism usually features one ultimate power to whom there is no use in praying, e.g. as in Greek mythology each god has their speciality and take an interest in human affairs, but they all are subject to fate, which has no particular interest in humanity or gods. Or in Norse, that of Ragnarok. 
* Monotheism is far more exclusive, and usually features one ultimate power who takes an interest in human affairs, e.g. the love of God for human. By the way, one key difference in Protestantism vs Catholicism is in how to ascend to heaven after death: Protestants would claim that God's love is so great that one can go to heaven as long as one has faith. Catholics would emphasize the importance of deeds: church activities, etc. Missionary.
* Natural order religion, like Buddhism. Craving leads to lives being trapped in the cycle of karma. By giving up craving, treating pain and joy with indifference, one can achieve nirvana, the ultimate inner peace.

World War II arguably is very much a war of religions: rather than different sects of a traditional religion such as Hussites vs Catholics or Sunnis vs Shiites, it's liberal humanism vs evolutionary humanism; and Cold War being liberal humanism vs social humanism.

Seeing what-is often times make us take what-is as granted: there is no other way.
One's lifespan is usually so short and horizon so limited that there is every other way which one may not have the eyes to see.
