# Addressing self

Nov 10, 2018


### Preface

It always surprises me how futile the attempts were to refrain from looking back, especially on a fine Saturday morning in office, overlooking the Central Park and having the entire floor to myself.

Often times the thoughts revolve around how much has changed and the naivete of my past (and current) self, that the regular feeling of deja vu started to convince me I was trapped in a labyrinth making little progress in terms of "real" realizations.

Perhaps such is the process of making realizations, however we don't enter the labyrinth empty-handed.
We dive in this time equipped with a ball of thread like what Theseus was given, in an attempt to jot down the fine details of our thoughts, through which we derive the core values and principles.

### External conditions

Recent events reinforced the realization how much of my fate is not in my own hands.
For the first time in my last five years as an immigrant to this country, I saw how limited my freedom is, in pursuing what I deemed worthy, in particular due to the restrictions in switching employers and traveling abroad.

This may be a moment when I swallow my pride, fear and anxiety, and accept it for what it is, as the serenity prayer would preach.
On one hand, to live and learn is but the best option we have, and on the other hand, there is something to be salvaged out of every misfortune, and it is exactly through such we evaluate ourselves, steer our goals and harden our resolve.

In these endeavors, know that we do not bow easily to the whims of external conditions.
I hold firm in the belief that the true excellence of an individual is decoupled from external conditions.

The goal is to master my own fate.
The way there is through the pursuit of knowledge.
And in the pursuit I aim to stay true to the virtues described in later sections, and weather the storms with faith and temperance.

### Pursuit of knowledge

We often times pondered, what it means to really know something, and among all the arts in this world, what would be worth knowing.

The majority of my life was spent as a student, yet among the many things I was taught, I cannot say I learnt most of them.
One can read a book, audit a course, labor in pratices, yet all of these are ways of obtaining knowledge, mostly irrelevant with evaluating whether our goal of learning something is achieved.

I often times see these feats from those considered masters of their own arts:
* To be able to explain it to a community, both from a high level and in-depth, in order to cater to different interest and skill levels of the audience.
* To be able to connect the dots when something seemingly irrelevant to the untrained eyes is brought up.
* To be able to apply what they know to produce something tangible.

Perhaps this is better phrased as to internalize something, and to grasp the underlying principles (or confluences, by the analogy of some cross-disciplinary scholars).

Our pursuit of knowledge is then characterized by the same feats.
Let us not rest in the comforts of having read something, but one step further of pondering, discussing, applying and teaching what we have read, as true tests of our internalization of such knowledge.
In the field of engineering, this can come in the forms of understanding the design alternatives, building something with it, having seminal discussions with like-minded people, and many others.
For all of which we should seek and create opportunities, if we find them lacking.

When reflecting daily what we have achieved, let us make sure to apply the same criteria of internalization.

### Open-mindedness

The topic of what is worth internalizing is a subjective and mercurial one.

I appreciate the beauty in most trades, be it various fields of liberal arts, sciences and engineering, skills in particular sports, interpersonal relationships, and many other techniques.
Such diversity is what makes here an incredible place for the curious, whose efforts are fueled by the freedom to pursue these.

It is my goal to number among the curious.
To be ready and excited waking up each morn thinking about the new knowledge we are going to internalize, and the new challenges we are going to tackle.

To take in, think and act with an open mind, and be open and flexible to change, without losing sight of what we set out to achieve, or failing to adhere to our principles.

To reflect, strengthen what we did well, and readily acknowledge where I was wrong, and to not judge others for our differences in the perception of what is worth internalizing.

### Compassion, gratefulness, and humility

I was gifted with a loving and supportive family.
We were not affluent in our wealth, but never lacked the means to afford food, lodging or education.
Throughout my life I was fortunate enough to learn from many whom I admire and appreciate.

Such cannot be said for many others, not for those from a poor rural area where I taught in 2011, and not even for my parents who grew up in turbulent times.
It is not due to their lack of endeavors (the cases usually suggest quite the opposite), but simply a factor of luck.

To such fortune and those who participated in weaving it we show gratitude.
And to cherish these that we arguably aren't worthy of, we work and learn hard, and pay it forward.

Do not ridicule, or easily discredit anyone: it could be just a difference in habits, belief, temperament and priorities.
Most in life are burdened with their own struggles, be it career, health, relationships and many others.

Do not think that the troubles you face are the biggest adversity, decide what few accomplishments you have deserve the attention and praise of all, or boast what little you own and realize.
Listen attentively, show compassion, be supportive, learn from them, and heartily congratulate them for their achievements.

Greed, vanity and ignorance often cloud our judgment, do not fall victim to the temptations of such.

### Courage, determination and discipline

Readily jump into actions.

Perseverance, rituals, habits.

The wisest men follow their own directions.

### Fragility of life

To clear the unworthy out of your mind, and to learn like you will not be able to tomorrow.

### Opportunities, choices and trade-off

The beauty of computer science
