### A better place

Hiç Şüphesiz ki Antalya dünyanın en güzel yeridir.
(Without a doubt Antalya is the most beautiful place in the world).

Having spent an entire day traversing from city's numerous beaches to vast Anatolian hills, I can see Atatürk's exclamation being quite reasonable.

Seeing locals young and old swimming in tranquil waters of the Mediterranean and basking on a rocky shore on a warm September day was not something I had expected when planning the trip, nor was the delicate old city, or the panoramic escalators leading to its natural harbor.

Yet the city did leave a brush of shadows upon my mind.

Coming back from a night photography session at the Duden falls, my host Sahar (Sara) asked me to guess where she was from.
I would not have suspected her not being a native, having experienced how diverse Turkish people can look.
When she brought up Iran something about her looks did click: elegant and shapely, very much like the few Persian ladies I met back in New York.


What do you think it's like, to migrate from 40 degrees hell to 20 degrees?

"I hope to see you again in a better place someday", she replied.
I thought to myself, perhaps a better place I know not, nor do I find it likely that our paths would ever cross again.
I offered to help in any way I can, she smiled gently and asked only for my best wishes.

With that we parted, and my last stop awaits.

Hers, as well as those of many others, would be an ordeal I cannot presume to comprehend.
I ask of myself to cherish what I was given, to work hard to be worthy of it, to listen and not judge, to treat the world with kindness and help those in need.
