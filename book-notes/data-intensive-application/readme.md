# Designing Data Intensive Applications

### Chap 1. Reliability, scalability and maintainability

Data intensive and compute intensive

##### Reliability

* Fault and failure
* Hardware error, usually uncorrelated and handled by redundancy
* Software error, usually happens when certain assumptions about the system don't hold any more. Correlated and cascading and harder to debug
* Human error

##### Scalability

* Defining load

**The Twitter example: to handle large fanout large read workload problem**
* Relational query approach
* Fanout queue approach

* Measuring performance
  * Percentiles
  * Load parameters
  * Head of line blocking
  * Tail latency amplification

* Conventional wisdom for scaling databases or stateful data systems is to scale up (grow tall, as opposed to scale out / grow wide) until you hit a limit (Think ComDB2)
* Elasticity

##### Maintainability

* Operability, simplicity, extendibility / agility of a system
* Complexity as native to the use case / required functionality, or accidental: debt and hacks accumulated over time, fitting a circle into a square, etc. Good abstractions, albeit hard to come by, help bring down accidental complexity.
* Non-functional requirements

### Chap 2. Data model and query languages
