# Notes on portraiture

# Composition

Composition is about arranging elements in your picture such that they are comfortable / harmonious to look at.

Symmetry, rule of thirds, etc, are ways to serve this goal of emphasizing the subject.

### Focal element

* Have a resting point for the eyes in your picture: something that a viewer is drawn to immediately.
* Elements that draw our eyes
  * Leading lines
  * Frame: look for frames and be flexible in your frames, they don't have to be rectangular, tree branches, a bridge, a shoreline can all serve as a frame
  * Geometric shapes: squares, circles
  * Vignette / darkened cornered
  * Human / animal face
  * Repetition
* Ways to emphasize your subject
  * Size
  * Color (hue cold-warm, saturation, luminance)
  * Blur (DoF, motion)
  * High contrast between the background and the subject
* Use these techniques on subjects, and avoid these on the background.

(Also refer to the notes in sdp)

### Structure

### Balance

### Common problems to avoid

* Cut-off. Cutting off one's limbs / joints can be unideal, in that our eyes expect to see the parts cut off, and having them cut off would then be a distraction to portraying the subject.
* Distracting background. In addition to being overly colorful, an unideal background could have trees / other objects with low contrast from your subject sprout from the subject's head. Observe the background, and move as needed.
* Foreground distortion. Due to perspective distortion and foreground being closer to your lens, it may appear abnormally large. (Character's nose when shooting face, feet when shooting a subject lying towards you, etc). Try changing angle / lens.

### Properties of light

Laws of illumination

* Law of **reflection**: the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. (e.g. moving your camera to avoid directly capturing reflection)
* **Inverse square law of illumation**: at any point on a plane perpendicular to the line joining the point and source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the source and plane.
E = I / d^2 (the closer the lighting source to the subject, the more obvious how brightness transitions in different parts of the subject having different distance to the source.)
* Size of lighting source >> subject: soft lighting, soft edges, low contrast; size of lighting source << subject: hard lighting, sharp edges, high contrast. Distance affects the **relative size** of source and subject. (The sun projects hard lighting due to its distance being too far away)
* Reflection casts the **color** of the subject's surroundings onto the subject
* Rougher surface: **diffuse reflection**, diffused vs concentrated reflection on a mirror surface.

### Outdoor lighting

Identify your source lighting.
The sun / street lamp, their angle. (Remember that camera will be more sensitive to lighting; look at the shadows your lighting casts; angle and edge)

Identify mirror-like surface in your surrounding. (e.g. building surface, reflect soft light, change direction)

Illuminating your subject horizontally is prefered over vertical (top-bottom or bottom-top)

Color of objects in the background. Low contrast / clean in background => emphasize your subject better

Color, texture / surface (lighting) of objects in the frame that might distract.

Ground color, texture.

Patches of shadow.

Try casting **bright enough**, **horizontal** and **soft enough** light on your subject.

Avoid dark subject, bright background. 

Don't just choose background. Choose lighting over background.

Natural lighting outdoors hard sunlight (roughly f/2, 1/1000 ~ 1/4000, see if the subject is properly exposed)

Portraiture, try not to compensate camera setup for lighting, instead try moving the subject such that it's properly lit under your ideal camera setup?

Check if eyes are properly lit, will properly reflect (catch light). Don't just use forehead / cheeks to decide that the face is properly lit.

### Flash

* Through the Lens (auto mode, 82% brightness on HSL)
* Flash Exposure Compensation (compensation +- on top of TTL)
* Manual mode. GN value / flash index (max light output)

* When using flash, your shutter speed no longer decides exposure, as flash is typically on, for, say 1/9000s. Aperture and iso can.
  * Aperture = GN-value * fraction * sqrt(ISO / 100) / distance (meters)

* Front curtain sync, rear curtain sync. Flash activates when shutter's about to open / close. Matters for moving objects.
* High speed sync. Usually the fastest shutter speed to work with flash is 1/200s to 1/250s, unless high speed sync is turned on. High speed sync comes at the cost of exposure, you get 1/4 to 1/8 exposure at maximum.
* Flash focal length. Coverage. Wide-angle (weaker) / telephoto (stronger).
