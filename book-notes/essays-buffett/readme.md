# Essays of Warren Buffett

### Corporate management

* Trumpeting EBIDTA is sus
* Unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management
* CEOs claiming to know the future and always trumping earnings projections and growth expectation is sus

It's far easier for an inadequate CEO to keep their job, compared to a subordinate: performance standards are fuzzy.

Different manager/owner situations in public company:
* Corporation with no controlling shareholder (most common). Board is an agent between owners and management. Board of directors ought to mostly come from the outside. Board should be business savvy and have interest in the business, not selected for diversity / prominence, have the long term interest of shareholders in mind, and replace mediocre management -- may be difficult for board to deal with mediocrity.
* Controlling owner is the manager (like Berkshire). Usually facilitated by two classes of stock with disproportionate voting power. Board should resign if disagree with management -- limited what board can do, owner not going to fire themselves.
* Controlling owner not involved in management (like Hershey, Dow Jones). Board convinces the owner when unhappy with management -- board likely more effective.

Most CEOs are men and women you would be happy to have as trustees for your children's assets or as next-door neighbors.

Board "independence".
Most boards fail at their tasks of booting bad / finding good management and negotiating low enough fees of them (they are not incentivized / knowledgable / care enough to do that).

Buffett hires and attracts outstanding managers to run various businesses (through acquisition), those who love what they do and think like owners. With good managers, Buffett's job easily scales. Each such manager should run their business as if they own 100% of it, it's the only asset they'll ever have, and they can't sell or merge it for a century. Don't have them worry about board meetings, financing, credit ratings or Street's expectation of EPS (short term profits -- when short term and long term conflict, long term must take precedence).
If each of us hires smaller than we are, we become a company of dwarves. If each hires bigger than we are, we become a company of giants.

### Changing business

Berkshire Hathaway textile, passed onto good management. Then Buffett's entry into insurance, branching into candy and newspaper and liquidating textile business (being priced out by competition from foreign cheap labor).
Business synergy during acquisition.

The textile business had promising reduction in cost / expansions through large capital expenditure, viewed independently each were good investments, but competitors domestic and abroad are making the same investments, and viewed collectively the comparative edge was minimal.

Apply much brain power and energy to a faulty premise then you get nothing.
A textile company that allocates assets brilliantly is a remarkable textile company -- but the business itself is not remarkable.

Managerial record as measured by economic returns is far more a function of what business you are in, than how effectively you perform.
If you find yourself in a leaking boat, investing efforts into changing boat might be more productive than fixing leaks.

Newspaper used to be high returns -- no matter how inept the management they couldn't avoid profits gushing in.
Back when it used to be the primary source of information: even finding groceries and job opportunities.
The industry demonstrated survival of the fattest -- advertisers preferred wide circulation, and readers want the ones with the most ads and news pages.
The fattest in a city wins and without competition the profits starts to roll.

Those days are over. Fixed costs are high in newspaper and they are constantly losing ground to newer forms of media.

### Social compacts

Railroad and energy utilities ventures.

The business and the public both should behave in a way that encourages good behavior from the other.

### Owner based approach to corporate charity

Most directors, as representatives of owners, direct funds to their favorite charities, and the choice is not up to owners themselves.
Berkshire allows owner to participate in the company's charity donation.

### Executive pay

Measure manager's performance using return on investment, not just return.

Rewarding manager with fixed price long term option doesn't put managers and owners in the same financial boat: the holder of this option bears no capital cost, but the owner cannot escape capital cost.

For a manager incentivized by fixed price long term option, it might be beneficial for him to eschew dividends payment and use all earnings to buy back shares (while keeping a constant p/e ratio) -- driving up stock prices but serving no interest of owners or improving the business. "Heads I win, tails you lose".

Every dime paid out in dividends reduce the value of all outstanding options.
In the executive suite today, it may be that nothing succeeds like failure.

In Berkshire, performance of a manager is defined in different ways depending upon the underlying economics of the (subsidiary) business unit and not on the Berkshire stock price. Compensate for returns they generate as well as capital they release.

In recent years compensation committees too often have been tail-wagging puppy dogs meekly following recommendations by consultants, a breed not known for allegiance to the faceless shareholders who pay their fees.

### Risk, reputaion and oversight

A CEO must not delegate risk control -- it's too important.

Audit committee, auditors.

Culture. Flexibility w.r.t. capital allocation and alignment between owners and managers. Bureaucracy begets bureaucracy.

# Finance and investing

### Farm, real estate, and stock

The key to successful investing was the purchase of shares in good businesses when market prices were at a large discount from underlying business values.

On his farm and real estate investments
* You don't need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren't, you must recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don't swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick no.
* Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don't feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset's future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate every investment possibility. But omniscience isn't necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.
* If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating. There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. The fact that a given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.
* Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time. Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important.

Difference with stocks: the valuation of his real estate investments weren't known and broadcasted all the time.

Owners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits—and, worse yet, important to consider acting upon their comments.

When Buffett buys stocks (thought of as small portions of businesses),
* first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out, or more (economic prospects, people in charge).
* If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at a reasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate.
* If, however, we lack the ability to estimate future earnings—which is usually the case—we simply move on to other prospects. 
Never foregone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment.
Buying without having in mind the time to sell.

### Mr Market

Mr. Market is here to serve you, not guide you. It will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.

If you aren't certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market you don't belong in the game.

In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.

The hamburger analogy in stocks market.

### Arbitrage

Buffett prefers long term investment, but often there's more cash than good ideas.
Engaging these cash in short term corporate action arbitrage might be better than T-bill in returns.

Questions to ask
* How likely is it that the promised event will indeed occur
* How long will your money be tied up
* What chance is there that something still better will transpire—a competing takeover bid, for example
* What will happen if the event does not take place because of anti-trust action, financing glitches, etc

Berkshire arbitrage diversifies little.

### Efficient market hypothesis

All public known information are priced in.
The market is often, but not always, efficient and that makes all the difference.

### Risk

The academic's definition of risk is far off the mark: beta (relative volatility) as opposed to the dictionary "possibility of loss or injury".
The real risk an investor must assess is whether his after-tax receipts from an investment will, over his prospective holding period, give him at least as much purchasing power as he had to begin with, plus a modest rate of interest on that initial stake.

Some factors to evaluate this risk
* The certainty with which the long term economic characteristics of the business can be evaluated
* The certainty with which the management can be evaluated (their ability to realize the full potential of the business and wisely employ its cash flows)
* The certainty with which the management can be counted on to channel the reward from the business to the shareholders rather than to itself
* The purchase price of the business
* The levels of taxation and inflation that will be experienced

There are shortcomings -- a business that must deal with fast moving technology is not going to lend itself to reliable evaluations of its long term economics (TV and computer industries were forego)

### Diversification

It's too hard making hundreds of smart investment decisions (like Coca Cola).
One good idea a year.

The efforts in arbitrage, on the other hand, requires wide diversification.

Wide diversification is required when an investor does not understand the economics of the business but nevertheless believes it in his interest to be a long term owner of that business, making index fund buying a good strategy for them.

If you are a know-something investor, able to understand business economics and to find some reasonably priced companies that possess long term competitive advantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you.

Continually search for large businesses with understandable, enduring and mouth-watering economics that are run by able and shareholder-oriented managements, and buy at a sensible price.

Keynes:
put fairly large sums into enterprises which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes.
It is a mistake to think that one limits one's risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which one knows little and has no reason for special confidence.
One's knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself entitled to put full confidence.

Volatility caused by money managers who speculate irrationally with huge sums will offer the true investor more chances to make intelligent investment moves. He can be hurt by such volatility only if he is forced, by either financial or psychological pressures, to sell at untoward times.

### Value investing: a redundancy

Find an outstanding business at a sensible price, not a mediocre business at a bargain price.

A critical skill for CEOs is capital allocation, yet not many are good at it: they rise to CEO not because of their skill in capital allocation.
Many employ external help, whose effects aren't necessarily good. This is why restructuring happens often in corporate America.

Now what's a reasonable price?
Most analysts choose between "value" and "growth". Berkshire views growth as a component of value, hence value as in value investing becomes redundant.

Growth benefits investors only when each dollar used to finance growth can create over a dollar in market value.

Value is the sum of future cashflow discounted by an interest rate incurred during the remaining lifetime of the asset.
For bond this is well defined, for stocks the investor has to estimate themselves -- this is hard, and Berkshire sticks to businesses they know, and enforces a margin of safety (threshold, cornerstone to success). An investors need to do very few things right as long as they avoid big mistakes.

The best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return.
Unfortunately most high return business need little capital, and shareholders of such business usually benefit the most if the business pays out its earnings in dividends or buy back shares.

An intelligent investor in common stocks will do better in secondary markets than he will do buying new issues.
Sellers in the primary market is less ruled by mass folly -- they only unload when they feel the market is overpaying.

### Intelligent investing

Inactivity is the intelligent behavior.
Acquire at a sensible price a business with excellent economics and able, honest management.
Then you need only monitor whether these qualities changed.

Berkshire favors businesses and industries unlikely to experience major changes.
It applauds the innovation but prefer to skip the ride.

Many companies in high tech businesses will grow much faster in percentage terms than The Inevitables like Coke, but Berkshire would rather be certain of a good result than be hopeful of a great one.

Investors making purchases in an overheated market must realize it might take a long time for the value of an outstanding company to catch up with the price they paid.

Loss of focus is what worries Berkshire the most when they contemplate investing in businesses that in general look outstanding.

Most individuals and institution will find the best way to own common stocks is via index funds charging minimal fees.
Those following this path beats most investment professionals.

Should you, however, choose to construct your own portfolio, you need the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses -- you only have to be able to evaluate companies in your circle of competence.
The size of this circle is not important, but knowing where the boundary lies is important.

Investment students need only two well taught lessons - how to value a business and how to think about market prices.

If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes.

### Cigar butts and institutional imperative

If you buy a stock at a sufficiently low price, there will usually be some hiccup in the fortunes of the business that gives you a chance to unload at a decent profit, even though the long-term performance of the business may be terrible.
Like a cigar butt you pick from the street -- there is one puff left. This approach to buying business is foolish.

When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.

In both business and investments it is usually far more profitable to simply stick with the easy and obvious than it is to resolve the difficult.
Berkshire's done better by avoiding dragons rather than slaying them.

Rationality frequently wilts when the institutional imperative comes into play:
* An institution will have inertia -- resist any change in its current direction.
* Just as work expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisition will materialize to seize available funds.
* Any business craving of the leader, however foolish, will be supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared for by his troops.
* The behavior of peer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting executive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.

Berkshire never succeeded in making a good deal with managers not trusted or admired.

Some of Berkshire's worst mistakes were not visible to the public -- they passed on a couple big purchases served on a platter which Buffett was fully capable of understanding.

Consistently conservative financial policies (more leverages) might have been a mistake but not in Buffett's view: in retrospect more leverage could have generated more returns, but a small chance of distress cannot be offset by a large chance of extra returns.

### Life and debt

Except for token amounts, Berkshire shuns debts.

Unquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However, that's also been a way to get very poor.
History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes (multiplied at the end of a stream of very impressive numbers), even when it is employed by very smart people.

Leverage can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that these obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, either because of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by payment. For that, only cash will do the job.

Borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed. When either is missing, that's all that is noticed.

Berkshire consistently keeps a large sum of cash (in US T bills) in hand to withstand unprecedented insurance losses (like Katrina), and quickly seize acquisitions or investment opportunities even in time of turmoil.

# Investment alternatives

### Surveying the landscape

* Investments denominated in a currency (money market funds, bonds, mortgages, bank deposits) are considered safe but among the most dangerous due to inflation tax. Berkshire does not favor them in a low interest rate environment, but has to keep some around for liquidity requirement of the insurance industry, usually in the form of T bills.
* Another possibility is instruments bought because there is likely a large group of buyers willing to pay a higher price. Like tulips, or gold.
They do not procreate.

These 2 categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: terror over economic collapse drives people to cash based investments.

* Berkshire's preference is investment in productive assets: business, farms, real estate.
Some of these assets perform poorly in inflation, like utilities requiring heavy capital requirements, while others like Coca Cola performs just fine.
Even so, the utilities sector will remain superior to non-productive or currency-based assets.

Berkshire's goal will be to increase its ownership of first-class businesses.
The first choice would be to own them in their entirety, if not, then by holding large amounts of marketable stocks.

This category of investing over a long period should be safest and earn the most reward.

Bank industry, highly levered, mistakes are common and costly, and risk exposure.

The most common cause of low prices is pessimism —- sometimes pervasive, sometimes specific to a company or industry. We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it produces. It's optimism that is the enemy of the rational buyer.

However, a contrarian approach is just as foolish as a follow-the-crowd strategy. What's required is thinking rather than polling.

### More investment alternatives

Junk bonds, 0-coupon / pay-in-kind bonds.

Preferred stocks.

Derivatives.

Foreign currency and assets.
Berkshire holds assets denoted in foreign currencies.
Increasing American trade deficit has led to foreigners owning more of American corporations. This is problematic if left unaddressed.

# Common stock

Two contageous disease, fear and greed, will forever occur in the investment community.
Our goal is to be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.

### The bane of trading: transaction costs

For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.

Berkshire shares have consistently sold in an unusually narrow range around intrinsic business value, and that is the goal, not maximizing the price at which Berkshire trades.
Berkshire lists on NYSE to reduce transaction cost for its shareholders -- narrower spreads than OTC markets, and not to achieve a higher valuation on Berkshire shares.

Berkshire wants very little activity and attracts long term owners.

### Dividend policy and share repurchases

Allocation of capital is crucial for business and investment management.
Under which circumstances should a business retain its earnings, or distribute to investors as dividends?

All earnings are not created equal.
Inflation causes the earnings of many businesses with high asset/profit ratios to become ersatz (inferior replacement goods).
This ersatz portion ("restricted" earnings) cannot, if business is to retain its economic position, be distributed as dividends.
A company that consistently distributes this portion is destined for oblivion unless equity capital is otherwise infused.

The "unrestricted" earnings can be retained or distributed. Managers should choose whichever course makes the more sense for owners.

Unrestricted earnings should only be retained when there is a reasonable prospect that for every dollar retained by the corporation, at least one dollar of market value will be created for owners.
You should wish your earnings be reinvested if they can be expected to earn high returns.

A company's management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business—projects to become more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from its competitors.

Many corporations that consistently showed good return on equity and on incremental capital have employed large amounts of their retained earnings on economically unattractive opportunities (usually involving overpriced acquisitions).
Yet their core business camouflaged repeatedly failures in capital allocation elsewhere.
In such cases, shareholders would be far better off if earnings were only retained to expand the high-return business, with the balance paid in dividends or to repurchase stocks.

As shareholders, stock repurchase by the company when there is large discrepancy between value and price is encouraging and rewarding.
It is a pro-shareholder move.

Repurchase can be also be made for an ignoble reason, to pump up the stock price. These repurchases are overcompensating leaving shareholders, at the cost of those continue holding.

Favor repurchases when two conditions are met: first, a company has ample funds to take care of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to the company's intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated.

### Stock splits, recapitalization

Berkshire did not split for fear of attracting worse investors (desirable ones are rational long term investors who think like Buffett).

A hyper-active market is the pick-pocket of enterprise.

Berkshire issues A shares and B shares. One A share can be converted into 30 B at any time, but not the other way round.
One B has 1/200 voting right of A, and and B will not be eligible to participate in shareholder-designated charitable contributions programs.
Roughly, B's price should be 1/30 of A.

B is a convenience for people making gifts.
