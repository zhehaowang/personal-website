Hi there!

My name is Zhehao Wang.

My full-time job is to develop software that trade stocks, in a company based in New York City.

I've a passion for everything engineering, and love to ponder about knowledge, conduct, cultures and life in general (duh).

I recently took an interest in photography, traveling (like everyone else did), and reading about philosophy and linguistics.

My resolution for 2020 is to get enough sleep :D
