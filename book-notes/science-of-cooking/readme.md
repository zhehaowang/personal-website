# Science of cooking

### Elements of taste

* salty, to keep internal salt level balanced
* sweet, indicating easy to digest
* bitter, potentially harmful, danger alert
* sour, acids, source of vitamin C, or has gone bad
* umami, (鲜), protein indication
* fatty, indicating rich energy

### Maillard reaction

Chemical reaction starting at 140 C / 284 F between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its distinctive flavor. (fuse / new flavor and aromatic substances.)
Seared steaks, crispy fish skin, fried dumplings, cookies and other kinds of biscuits, breads, toasted marshmallows, and many other foods undergo this reaction.

Since this happens beyond boiling point of water, the surface moisture needs to be driven off by heat first.

Intensifies (twice as quickly) at 150 C / 302 F, peaks at 160 C / 320 F.

**Pyrolysis** (burning) starts at 180 C / 356 F, food chars and becomes bitter.
Carbs, proteins, and then fat breaks down, leaving harmful substance.

### Pairing

Each food has characteristic flavor compounds, the chemicals that lend it its aroma, pungency, and taste.

Shared flavor compounds can often serve as basis for pairing (roasted beef with onion / wheat / butter / beer / peanut butter / mushrooms / coffee).

However, the theories do not account for a food's texture and don't always hold true for Asian and Indian cuisines, where spice combinations have very few or no flavor links.

### Knives

Material
* carbon steel
* stainless steel (with chromium)
* ceramic

Collection
* Serrated knife (Foods that have a tough crust or smooth, delicate skin, such as bread, cake, or large tomatoes where precision isn’t required.)
* Chef's knife (Finely slicing, dicing, disjointing large cuts of meat, and crushing garlic cloves with the side of the blade.)
* Paring knife (Slicing, peeling, coring, and delicate work such as stripping out vanilla beans.)
* Carving knife (Making thin cuts of meat from a large cut.)

### Pots and pans

Material
* Stainless steel (conducts heat poorly, food sticks easily.)
* Copper (heavy and expensive, conducts heat well, reacts to acid and needs coating.)
* Aluminum (conducts heat quickly and loses heat quickly off stove, lightweight, has coating)
* Carbon steel (heats up faster than stainless, but reacts to acid and rusts.)
* Cast iron (Very heavy, cast iron is dense and heats slowly, but, once heated, it retains heat well and is ideal for browning meat in a skillet or casserole. Also reacts with acid so season it, coat with protective nonstick seal and clean carefully. Avoid abrasive cleaners.)

**Pan's thickness**: the thicker the base, the more evenly the heat from the burner spreads across it.

Collection
* Wok
  * Stir-frying over the hottest flame, steaming, and deep-fat frying.
  * A tight-fitting lid, a thin base, and long sturdy handle. Avoid nonstick, which won’t tolerate high stir-frying heats. Carbon steel is ideal; to season it, scrub off the existing oil coat, heat to blacken, add oil to smoke, then rub off the oil when cool. Do this 3–4 times before use.
* Cast-iron skillet
  * Root veg, meats, sticky foods (if seasoned), putting under the broiler and in the oven.
  * A long, heat-proof handle (cast iron retains heat) and a grip handle to aid in lifting.
* Round casserole dish
  * Slow-braising meats.
  * A tight-fitting lid and easy-to-grasp handles. Although heavy, cast iron is ideal because it keeps a steady temperature, and an enamel interior is durable and doesn’t react with acids.
* Saucepan
  * Sauces, stews, soups, stocks, boiling vegetables, rice, and pasta.
  * Lids to retain moisture, and an extra small-grip handle on large pans to aid in lifting. Heat-proof handles are oven-friendly.
* 10in / 24cm frying pan
  * Delicate fish, eggs, and crêpes.
  * A thick base and thick nonstick coat—choose from a reputable supplier.
* 12in / 30cm saute pan
  * Searing and frying large batches; creating sauces and large meals.
  * A tight-fitting lid to hold moisture, a long handle, and a moderately heavy base.

### Utensils

Tools. (Not every invention is a step forwards—pay attention to how versatile it is and how the material works with different ingredients.)

* Measuring cup
* Digital scale
* Honing steel
* Rolling pin
* Balloon whisk
* Grater
* Metal sieve
* Slotted spoon
* Ladle
* Metal spatula (Sliding under delicate food)
* Thermometer (Look for one with a probe that can rest in a pan. Those that read to 410 F (210 C), can also be used for caramelizing sugar.)
* Rubber spatula (Delicate work)
* Wooden spoon (easy on the surface, poor conductor of heat, but it's a porous material and needs thorough cleaning!)
* Mixing bowl (Stainless steel lasts a long time, but can't be put in a microwave. Tempered glass is heat-resistant and microwave-friendly. Ceramic and stoneware can chip, are slow to warm, so ideal for working with dough.)
* Chopping board (Durable and good for all foods, wooden boards have "give" so they don't dull knives, unlike granite and glass. Plastic traps bacteria in grooves, while wood has bacteria-killing tannins, making it a hygienic choice.)

### Meat and poultry
