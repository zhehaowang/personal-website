# Part I: stocks and their valuation

### Firm foundation theory, intrinsic value

Stock valuation depends on the estimations of earning power of the company many years in the future.
(PV of cashflows a company is able to earn in the future for its investors)

### Castle-in-the-air theory, mass psycology

Styles and fashions in investors’ evaluations of securities can and often do play a critical role in the pricing of securities.
The stock market at times conforms well to the castle-in-the-air theory.
For this reason, the game of investing can be extremely dangerous.

Another lesson that cries out for attention is that investors should be very wary of purchasing today’s hot "new issue.
Most initial public offerings underperform the stock market as a whole.
And if you buy the new issue after it begins trading, usually at a higher price, you are even more certain to lose.
Investors would be well advised to treat new issues with a healthy dose of skepticism.
Certainly investors in the past have built many castles in the air with IPOs.
Remember that the major sellers of the stock of IPOs are the managers of the companies themselves.
They try to time their sales to coincide with a peak in the prosperity of their companies or with the height of investor enthusiasm for some current fad. In such cases, the urge to get on the bandwagon—even in high-growth industries—produced a profitless prosperity for investors.

Res tantum valet quantum vendi potest. (A thing is worth only what someone else will pay for it.)

### Dutch tulips bubble

**How futures contract made money**

The market engineers complex contracts to serve those seeking capital or investment outlets (or investors trying hard to part with their money).

### The tronics, biotech, and dotcom bubble

**Concept stocks**
The issues of a company with few or no earnings but a good story to tell and great potential.
Speculative and risky.

**How merger creates illusion of growth**


### The housing bubble

##### Mortgage backed security

For banks handing out mortgages, instead of the originate and hold system 30 years ago, it's now originate and distribute: mortgage loans were originated by the banks, who only holds them for a few days, until they could be sold to an investment banker.
The investment banker would then assemble packages of these mortgages and issue mortgage backed securities, derivative bonds "securitized" by the underlying mortgages.
These collateralized securities relied on the payments of interest and principal from the underlying mortgages to esrvice the interest payment on the new mortgage-backed bonds that were issued.
Making matters more complicated, there are multiple bonds issued against a package of mortgages.
Different tranches with different claim priorities.

Same goes for credit card loans and automobile loans.

##### Credit default swaps

Second-order derivatives such as CDS were sold on the mortgage-backed bonds.
CDS were sold as insurance policy on the mortgage-backed bonds, where one party would pay the other, in order to be paid back, in case of a default of the particular bond.

CDS traded in the market can be 10 times the value of the underlying, making today's financial system very much riskier and interconnected.

CDS being unregulated, and the mortgage originator facing a smaller risk (they only hold it for a few days before passing it on), led to looser and looser borrowing standards.
Increasingly, lenders did not even bother to ask for documentation about ability to pay.
Money for housing was freely available, and housing prices rose rapidly.

##### How it happened

Loosening borrowing standard made borrowing for housing easier. 

The government itself played an active role: its regulations required loans be easily available, to low-income borrowers.

Housing price in turn inflated due to buyers having easy access to capital, beyond their value.
(The inflation in housing prices encouraged more loans to be taken to be invested in buying houses, further jacking up housing prices. The positive loop in building up a bubble.)

Eventually mortgages buyers took became far more valuable than the house, and some buyers defaulted, returning the keys and causing the lenders to hold these toxic properties without a demand.
(The loop reversed in bursting a bubble.)

### Are the markets efficient

Markets can occasionally be irrational, but eventually it corrects itself: true value is recognized, and this is the main lesson investors must heed.

And true value, as stated in firm foundation theory, depends on the estimations of earning power of the company many years in the future.

The estimation cannot be accurately made, and market prices must always be wrong to some extent.
And even professional investors cannot estimate well enough to always hold the undervalued stocks and sell the overvalued ones.

# Part II: how the pros play the biggest game in town

### Technical analysis

Investment by castle-in-the-air theory.

Chartists.
Think a stock chart (line with a bar on y-axis for each point on x-axis) where it marks daily high, low, closing prices and volumes traded.

Make decisions based on patterns in the chart (e.g. head-and-shoulders), and ignore factors like income statement, balance sheet, etc. 

##### Does it really work

The history of stock price movements contains no useful information that will enable an investor consistently to out-perform a buy-and-hold strategy in managing a portfolio.

In other words, you are unlikely to beat buying index funds by staring at charts.

The claim is that stock price movement (in the short term) is a random process (hence the name, random walk).

Technical methods cannot be used to make useful investment strategies, and not one has consistently outperformed the simple buy-and-hold, with fees and taxes in mind.
This is the foundamental conclusion of the random walk theory.
Stock prices cannot be predicted on the basis of past stock prices.

### Fundamentals analysis

Investment by firm foundation theory.

Rules (of pricing a stock): a rational investor is willing to pay more if (given the same conditions otherwise)
* growth rate of dividends and earnings are higher
* a larger proportion of a company's earning is paid out in cash dividends or to buy back stock
* risk is lower (e.g. volatility as a measurement)
* interest rate is lower

Future growth, risk, interest rate cannot be determined (or deterministically) inferred from present.
Thus the precise price cannot be determined. (and pricing becomes a matter of assumptions and scenarios.)

When comparing different aspects above of two companies and deciding if one's price is undervalued, it's useful to compare **price / earning ratio** (P/E ratio, price per share divided by earnings per share).
With one company's P/E ratio as a benchmark, compare the above aspects to decide if another company's P/E ratio is higher or lower than expected.

##### Does it really work

Very few active fund managers outperform the market consistently.

Security analysis, or predicting the future, is fundamentally difficult due to random events, company "creative" accounting, mistakes of analysts, losing analysts to sales or portfolio managers, and conflict of interest between analysts and investment banking department.

With these, we introduce the **efficient market hypothesis**.
* The weak form suggests technical analysis - looking at past price patterns, cannot help investors.
* The semi-strong form suggests looking at public information (fundamental analysis) cannot help investors, either, due to the market being efficient, and stock pricing has already taken into account all the public information available.
* The strong form suggests even having insider information (fundamental analysis, but against the law) doesn't help, nothing helps. This tends to be an overstatement.

### View on HFT

HFT does not hurt individual investors.
Technology has always facilitated trading.

One way they can help is in pricing of ETFs: any discrepancy between the pricing of an ETF with its underlying stocks will quickly be arbitraged away, thus improving liquidity, better prices, and making the market more efficient.

That said, it would be illegal if optimally positioned traders can see the orders of others, and drive prices up or down before such orders are executed.
This kind of insider trading, called "front-running", is regulated by SEC.

### Combining fundamental and technical

* Buy only companies that are expected to have above-average earnings growth for five or more years (double the factor, price grows and P/E ratio grows)
* Never pay more for a stock than its firm foundation of value
* Look for stories whose stories of anticipated growth are of the kind on which investors can build castles in the air
* Avoid trading too much: incurs taxes and brokerage fees

Simply buying and holding a diversified portfolio suited to your objectives will enable you to save on investment expense, brokerage charges and taxes.

Over the past 30 years, 95 percent of stock market gains came from 1% of the total amount of trading days.

### Modern portfolio theory

(Given an efficient market) risk, and risk alone, determines the degree to which returns will be above or below average.

Risk can be measured as the standard deviation (volatility) of price (a random variable).

**Modern portfolio theory** shows how to combine diversified instruments to give the least risk possible with the return investors seek.

It's possible to reduce risk by diversification, as long as the individual instruments are not completely positively correlated.
Due to the possible negative correlation between different instruments and different currencies / economies, it's possible to obtain lower volatility and higher rate of return (to a certain degree) at the same time by diversification.

Globalization increases the correlation of instruments, especially in times of financial crisis.

### Capital-asset pricing model

Quantifying risk: **beta**.

Beta of a portfolio measures the relative price change of the portfolio to that of the market: if market goes up by 10% portfolio A goes up by 20%, then the portfolio is said to have a beta of 2.

The theory is that in an efficient market, an investor won't be rewarded for risk that can be mitigated by diversification (unsystematic risk, e.g. particular events of a company).
But the systematic risk (measured by beta), representing the basic variability of stock prices and the tendency of stock prices being positively correlated, cannot be diversified away.

And the higher the beta, meaning the more systematic risk an investor takes, the higher that investor's reward should be.
A portfolio manager then chooses the stocks with different beta characteristics to maximize his returns within his risk tolerance.

Popular in the 70s.

##### Does beta really work?

Not as-is: beta for individual stocks are not stable over time, and they are very sensitive to the market proxy against which they are measured (e.g. SP 500 does not account for the world's stock market, nor bonds, nor human resource assets for that matter).

The likes of arbitrage pricing theory, and Fama-French three factor model are introduced to bring in more factors, like interest rate, inflation, national income in the former, or market capitalization and market-to-book value ratio in the latter.

### Behavioral finance

Previous theories assume a perfectly rational investor, which is not the case.
Efficient market claims the random actions of irrational investors will cancel each other out as a whole, and that the arbitrageurs would smooth out irrational fluctuations in stock pricing.

However, behavioral finance suggests the irrational behavior of investors is continual rather than episodic.
And the systematic errors investors are prone to defeats the cancelling each other out claim, also effective arbitrage is difficult.

The irrational behavior can be attributed to these observations in psychology
* Overconfidence: study shows majority of people's self-assessment is that they are in the top quartile in many aspects. Making money is because of skill, and losing money is because of luck
* Biased judgment: the illusion of being in control, and able to beat the market
* Herding: statistically a group is more likely to make a rational decision than a single person. Not all the time, and a person's often times under pressure to conform to a group's erroneous view
* Loss aversion: people are more sensitive to loss than to income: rarely would someone accept a statistically fair bet: the expectation needs to be in his favor, and study shows, usually by a large margin. How the possibility of loss is phrased to them matters as well.
* Pride and regret: people tend to sell their best performers (whose selling is often times nonsensical due to incurring income taxes), and hold their worst ones until prices bounce back (which sometimes makes more sense to sell).

Plus, efficient arbitrage is difficult, due to its risk (in LTCM's case, what if spread continues to widen), sometimes unable to find similar instruments.
This results in being sophisticated traders like hedge funds often end up not being a pricing correction force in bubbles, but rather they helped the prices move in irrational direction (as in DotNet bubble).

**Insights from behavioral finance**: bow to the wisdom of the market, buy and hold an index, don't be your own worst enemy, and avoid stupid investor tricks.
In particular,
* avoid herd behavior
* avoid overtrading (the correct holding period for stock market is forever)
* if you do trade, sell losers (hold only if you have reasons to believe the company is still successful), not winners
* be wary of new issues (you are not going to get the best IPO deals. After the first six months when insiders are allowed to sell to the public, new issues generally perform worse than the market)
* distrust foolproof schemes (if something seems too good to be true, it is too good to be true. Market timing can only be accomplished by liars).

### "Smart beta" strategies

**"Smart beta"**: goal is to gain excess returns by using a variety of relatively passive investment strategies that tilt your asset allocation towards certain characteristics.

Some of these tilts / flavors include:
* Value wins. Favor low P/E ratio, low price-to-book-value. Risk: those two are often indication of crisis e.g. bankruptcy. Vanguard offers its value index fund, and growth index fund
* Smaller is better. Favor small company stocks. Risk: smaller companies are intrinsically more risky than established bigger ones, and survivorship bias. ETF IWB small cap fund is an example. Russell 1000, 2000 stock index tracks the largest US companies by market cap.
* Momentum and reversion to the mean. For a short period price shows momentum / inertia, and will then adjust to the fundamental value. (oscillation). Behavioral explanation, and investors taking time to react. Weakness: not uniform across studies, and weaker in particular periods of time.
* Low volatility can produce high returns. _buy margin?_
* Blended flavor: mix-and-match the above, recall Fama-French three factor model.

Keep in mind that
* The reason why smart beta can generate excessive return in a short period is most likely due to assuming extra risk (maybe not measured by beta, which is imperfect): by tilting your allocation in favor of certain factors, you are e.g. sacrificing diversification.
* These portfolios need to be actively managed and rebalanced, incurring additional management fees and trading fees.
* Over longer periods smart beta strategies underperform the market.

In conclusion, capitalization weighted indexing is unlikely to be deposed as the favorite.
The core of every portfolio should consist of low cost, tax efficient, broad based index funds.

# Part IV: practical guide for random walkers and other investors

* Gather the necessary supplies: save and invest early and regularly, do not touch money set aside. Do not dream of get rich quick. Buy and hold index funds.
* Don't be caught empty-handed, cover yourself with cash reserves and insurance. Assuming you are covered by medical and disability insurance at work, have enough cash reserve for three months. Fund the rest with investment whose maturity matches the date funding's required. Home, auto, health and disability insurances are a must; for ones with family life insurance is a must as well. Shop around for the best insurance deal. Advice is to buy renewable term life insurance.
* Be competitive, let the yield of your cash reserve keep pace with inflation (invest in money market mutual funds, bank certificate of deposit, Internet banks, T bills).
* Learn how to dodge the tax collector: IRA, Roth IRA (works well if you expect to pay more taxes after you retire, or if your income is low enough for pretax Roth IRA contribution), pension plans, 529 (college).
* Understand your investment objectives: the risk you are willing to take. Ordered in increasing risk and returns: bank accounts, money market funds, bank certificate of deposit, TILs, high quality corporate bonds, diversified portfolio of blue-chip US or developed country stocks, real estate (and REIT), diversified portfolio of smaller growth company stocks, diversified portfolio of emerging market stocks, gold, collectibles.
* Own your own home if you can possibly afford it. Also consider real estate investment trusts (REITs). They have produced returns comparable to common stocks, provide good diversification, and hedge against inflation.
* When navigating bond investment, zero-coupon bonds can be useful to fund future liabilities, no-load bond fund can be appropriate vehicles, tax-exempt bonds can be useful to high tax bracket investors, and inflation linked bonds can be a good way to maintain real purchasing power. Historiclly junk bonds gross yield premium has more than compensated for actual default experience.
* Tiptoe through the fields of gold, collectibles, and other investments. The book also recommends steering clear of hedge-fund, private equity and venture-capital funds. These are not for individual investors.
* Remember investment costs aren't random: some are lower than others.
* Avoid sinkholes and stumbling blocks: diversify your investment steps.

Five asset allocation principles:
* Risk and returns are related.
* Actual risk in stock and bond investing depends on the length of time you hold your investment: a substantial amount of risk can be eliminated by adopting a program of long-term ownership and sticking to it through thick and thin. (Imagine you are going to eat hamburgers for the next 10 years, you'd want hamburger prices to go down. Same goes for stocks, if you are not speculating and holding them for value, when you are young you are purely a consumer of stocks, and you should want stock prices to go down.)
* Dollar cost averaging can reduce the risk in stocks and bonds investment. This is controversial, but it simply means instead of looking for market timings, invest regularly a portion of your income, no matter if the price is high or low.
* Rebalancing (to your target stocks / bonds percentage) can reduce risk and possibly increase returns. 
* Distinguish your attitude toward and your capacity for risk. Your age, earning ability outside investment should decide your capacity for risk. An aggressive portfolio is recommended for the young and high earning power.

Guidelines to tailoring a lifecycle investment plan
* Specific needs requiring dedicated specific assets: e.g. housing down payment, college tuition. Zero coupon bonds and certificate of deposits could be useful.
* Recognize your tolerance for risk.
* Persistent savings in regular amounts, no matter how small, pays off.
* For those in their twenties, a very aggressive portfolio is recommended, as investors age, start cutting back on risky investments. Lifecycle funds offer this rebalancing if you want to avoid the hassle yourself.

Annuities can be useful (for investment after retirement), where you pay a lump sum and gets back an amount for the next x years (or as long as you are alive, sometimes inflation adjusted amount), but there are drawbacks in being unable to leave a bequest, and they can be costly and tax-inefficient.

How do you go about buying stocks? Three ways
* indexing: investing in a no-load index fund is recommended for most. Indexing, however, should use a broader definition, not just US S\&P 500 (major corporation in US market). US Total Stock Market, international stock markets, emerging markets should be a part of your indexing portfolio. Indexing is extremely effective in emerging markets, where risk and returns are generally higher than S\&P 500. ETFs can be used in lieu of indexing mutual funds, though ETFs require the cost of transactions: brokerage fees and crossing bid-ask spread. When indexing by world stock market aggregated, consider adding in more funds indexing Chinese stocks (YAO, TAO, HAO), as they are under-represented due to cannot be traded outside China, or significant government holding.
* do it yourself: follow the four suggestions in section combining-fundamental-and-technical.
* use a manager: few consistently outperform the market, and their past performance cannot be used to estimate future performance. The book suggests that investors never buy funds with expense ratios above 0.50% and with turnover more than 50%, and if you buy actively managed funds, look for closed-end funds traded at a discount that are only available through a broker. Any particular investment advice faces a paradox: if enough people know about it, it won't be a good investment any more. But "pick up the $100 bill quickly because if it's really there surely someone will take it".

# A final word

Broad diversification, annual rebalancing, using index funds, and staying the course.
The first decade of 2000 was a trying time where US total stock market funds lost money. But follow the simple rules and timeless lessons epoused in this bookm are you likely to do just fine even during the toughest of times.
