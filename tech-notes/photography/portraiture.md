# Notes on portraiture

# Composition

Composition is about arranging elements in your picture such that they are comfortable / harmonious to look at.

Symmetry, rule of thirds, etc, are ways to serve this goal of emphasizing the subject.

### Focal element

* Have a resting point for the eyes in your picture: something that a viewer is drawn to immediately.
* Elements that draw our eyes
  * Leading lines
  * Frame
  * Geometric shapes: squares, circles
  * Vignette / darkened cornered
  * Human / animal face
* Ways to emphasize your subject
  * Size
  * Color (hue cold-warm, saturation, luminance)
  * Blur (DoF, motion)
  * High contrast between the background and the subject
* Use these techniques on subjects, and avoid these on the background.
