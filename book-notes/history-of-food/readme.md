# History of food

### Stone age cooking

Gatherer hunters

We gather more than we hunt. Just that the bigger bones stick around more easily

Sea people move less than inland people.
Colder arctic areas generally have less variety in their diet.

### Early agriculturalists

Why did agriculture, or the domestication of plants come about?

A combination of accidents (storing food underground and seeing them grow), need (the food source that a group used to rely on becomes no longer available), and its ability to stably sustain larger amount of people. (As their gathering / society being more successful, the natural selection process passed the genes and habits of these collections of people on.)

Agriculture was not present among native Australians, Amazonians, etc, perhaps for lack of need for agriculture, or the lack of suitable plants to domesticate.

Suitable usually meaning a starch-based plant, wheat (Eurasia), rice (Asia), sorghum (Africa), potato (Americas), corn (Americas), quinoa (Americas).
First cultivation of wheat was found in the middle east. Syria, Israel, east Turkey, etc.

Domestication of animals followed suit. Dogs, sheep, goats, cattle (herding animals, usually herbivores) were among the first ones domesticated, and they were rarely bred for food, for dairy, utility, etc.

Indus river valley area perhaps saw the first domestication of chicken, usually bred for the eggs.

Pigs were domesticated at a later stage (except in China), due to its lack of utility to the early civilization: they don't eat grass, cannot be milked, etc, and can only provide meat.

Civilizations more reliant on dairy typically develops luctose tolerance.

Civilizations have long depended on benign bacteria for dairy, wine, bread, etc, and evolved along with those that cause disease.
The aboriginal people aren't as exposed to the disease Eurasians carry, and e.g. Meso-Americans, Tasmanians, people of the Canary Islands died in droves upon first contact with Europeans.

### Egypt

Earliest agricultural civilization. 4000BC Sumer, Iraq. Akkadian. Whose 1600BC work was the earliest written recipes.
A set of cities like Ur, Uruk, etc.

Egypt, physical and archaeological evidence of domestication, agriculture, recipes, etc.

Tigris and Euphrates are unpredictable rivers and Sumerians developed irrigation.
Over time the soil becomes over salinized, and the surrounding plains made the cities subject to invasions.

Nile, on the other hand, floods very predictably each year. Nile flood plain remains fertile to this day, and the surrounding desert provides protection.

Extensive trade network. To Nubia, Greece, and Semitic peoples.

Grains, emmer (predecessor of wheat), barley (a symbol of resurrection), beans.
The state has grain storage, and use grain as exchange.
Beer drinking habits. Brewed wine.
Raised bread and use of yeast. Cone shaped loaves. Bad teeth from saddle quern grinding technique.

Game meat.
Beef and a large scale cattle industry. (the goddess Hathor)
Boiled meat.
Sacred bulls for the priests, reincarnation of the god Apis, and delivers prophecy, mummified afterwards.
Seemed to eat pork but avoided pork later, and pigs are forbidden to be used in sacrifices.
Domesticated chicken not until Ptolemaic time.
Salted fish.

Lettuce, cabbage, cucumbers, a wide variety of beans (lentils, chickpeas), lotus.
Papyrus.
Spices like cumin, mustard.
Sesame oil, imported olive oil. Animal fats for cooking.

Egyptians were well fed, and many over-ate. Alcoholism among priests.
Malnutritions Intestine worms from walking in the river.

Food buried in tombs with mummies.

No universal rigid food restrictions. Priests might have.

### Ancient Judea

Old Testament, mythological version of real events.

Eden. Adam and Eve. Fruit eaters. All killing is wrong.

Punishment for disobedience: labor. Gain your food from hardship.

Caine and Abel. Farmer and shepherd.
Punishment: wander the earth alone with a mark to be kept alive, land will not produce for him. A nomadic different from that of the Judean people.

Noah. Sacrifice to God. After which God claims all living creatures are food for you. But he wants justice from murder / killing (scapegoat).
Only dietary restriction: can't eat blood.

**Passover** (March/April). Moses and Israelites in Egypt.
Derived from smearing blood on your household, such that God does not take away the firstborn of the Judean household, but only those of Egyptians.

Food traditions derived from the exodus (no raised bread, etc).

Later on more food traditions are added: recline as opposed to sitting straight. Four glasses of wine, etc.
This has to do with a time when Israel was under Greek occupation. 

The Promised Land, given ten commandments, and how to perform sacrifice.

Dietary restriction of the Hebrews:
* **kosher animal**: anything that "chews the cud" (vegetarian animals) and has a completely split hoof is ritually clean, but those animals that only chew the cud or only have cloven hooves are unclean.
  * Camel, pigs, hare, etc, are then not clean. Nor is shellfish, snails, snakes, bats, or fish without scale.
* They need to be slaughtered in a certain way.
* Nor are certain culinary methods allowed: mixing milk and the meat of the animal (e.g. cheeseburger).

The Book of Leviticus also introduces the following:
* The tradition of fasting.
* **Rosh Hashanah** (September/October), Jewish new year.
* The Sabbath. Seventh day of the week, commanded by God as a holy day of rest. The year of Jubilee.
* Tithe. One tenth of all produce to support priests.

Under Saul, David and Solomon, the Jewish people conquered its neighbors.

The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Assyrians then later Babylonians, which induces an age of prophets. Destruction of the 1st temple.

Under the Persians Jews were allowed to return. Construction of the 2nd temple.
And then Greeks took over and the old testament ended. **Hanukkah**(December) derived from a revolt against the Seleucids in this period.

Romans then took over. Destruction of the 2nd temple. Worships happen at each household.

### Greece - classical

Presumably mountainous terrain making it hard to get somewhere via land led to flourishing sea trade.

And lack of arable land made it hard to feed a large population, and contributed to Greek colonization of west of Turkey, south of Italy (magna graecia), Sicily, south of France (Marseille), east of Spain, and the Black Sea / Ukraine.

The hilly terrain was suitable for olive trees and vineyards.
Long summers.
Goods for trade. Enriched a class of citizens that patronizes philosophy, arts and gastronomy.

Homer's work in which heroes favored beef. The bigger the animal, the better. (Pastures are rare.)

Public festivals. Different cults.
Dionysian cult and its similarity with Christian analogy bread and wine.
Drama tradition and loss of self identity in Dionysian ecstasy.

Pythagoras vegetarian.

Symposium as a social gathering of people eating and then drinking / telling stories, not in the Platonic sense.

Plato would value ideals and thoughts over secular desires such as food, a distraction from the important pursuits.
This "food guilt" / preference may have left a trace throughout western civilization, later magnified by Christian teaching.

Part of Archestratus's cookbook survived till today. Written in verses mostly on fish, presumably to be read at symposiums.
Simplicity over complexity, emphasis on where the fish came from.

Fresh milk (and butter) is rarely eaten by Greeks (barbarians do), presumably having to do with its being hard to preserve in warm weather. They make cheese instead.

### Greece - Alexandrian

The conquest of Alexander introduced pepper (India), ginger (India), citrus (Southeast Asia), peach (Persia), cinnamon (Sri Lanka), apricots to Greek cuisine.

Dining also became luxurious, as authors of his time would find the eastern mannerism feminine, soft and weak.

Nutrition theory of the Hippocratic school started before Alexander's time, and lasted well into Imperial Rome.
The most prolific author being Galen of Pergammon, physician of Marcus Aurelius.

The authors of Hippocratic school claims four fluids of the body (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. **Humorism**) echoes with the four elements (earth, fire, water and air)

Food, as classified by hot / cold, dry / moist, would help with some of the four aspects, and nutrition is about finding balance between the four fluids via food.
Each individual is different in which fluids are prevalent, and should be treated differently.

Stoics advocated an austere, virtuous view on food, and proposed to avoid the luxuries.
Epicureans likewise, to not desire something so much such that its deprivation would cause pain.

### pre-12th century India

Cities along the Indus River, like Mohenjo Daro are founded around Minoan Crete / Akkadian cities, but much less is understood about the former.

Ancient Indian civilization saw the invasion of Aryans (middle eastern / Iranian (land of Aryans)), nomad, light-skinned, and war-like.

Around the same time Hittites invaded Turkey, Dorians Greece.
Aryans had beef and butter being prevalent in their diet. And theirs would be a time when cows weren't yet seen as sacred.

**Rigveda** (veda - I know / I see / wisdom / knowledge, vidi in Latin and vision in English) in Sanskrit was the important religious text.

Some religious beliefs include gods are essence / primordial existence, and in this sense, **Atman** (self). All creations are the same, and there was emphasis on reverence for all life. This suggested vegetarianism.

And through meditation, mantra, and cutting out bodily need, one can reconnect with the greater cosmos, or Atman.
Some followers of Shiva would even attempt to do so through bodily mutilation.

Caste system was also brought about by the Aryans to differentiate the conquers and the conquered (Dravidian).
The caste system would feature no social mobility.

The divination of cows came later, presumably during times of famine and hardship when the Brahmin needed to invent new text and rules to justify and maintain their supremacy.
The idea of reincarnation, transmigration of souls, divinity of cows (the ultimate vessel of reincarnation, it takes 86 transmigrations from devil to cow) were introduced.
Umpanishads of 800BC came about this time.

Food taboos include those with 5 toes, 2 rows of teeth, too much hair or no hair. Ducks, swans, e.g. are also forbidden, and the concept of fried food, milk and beans being pure, and leftovers, meat, alcohol being polluted food came about.

Lower class would only observe the above convention on festivals.

Then Buddha, an aristocratic prince, came about, and wandered the earth to relieve the world of its suffering.
He advocated having no desire, no violence, strict vegetarianism, and through such break the chain of causation to reach the state of nothingness / nirvana.

Ashoka, who reigned about 50 years after the conflict with Alexander, was a buddhist (after butchering to bolster his rule) and enforced vegetarianism in his domain.

Ayurveda (Ayur - lifetime / longevity) was a book on nutritions where the theory was similar with that of the Hipprocratic school: five elements air, fire, water, earth and space, make up the different aspects (dosha) of our body (fire + water -> metabolism, water + earth -> structure, air + space -> breath / ideas). And one seeks to strike a balance via diet, and energy inflow through meditation (and spices).

The Indian cuisine as popularized by the west largely featured northern India, under the influence of its later Islamic rulers / middle eastern conquerors.
Creamy food, korma, tandoori, kebap, etc.

Southern Indian food traditions are different, e.g. dosa.

Basmati (and other branches of) rice, millet, wheat are prevalent.
As are legumes (various kinds), dairy (e.g. paneer), yoghurt (lassi), mango, and eggplant.

Indian cuisine has always been rich in spices.
The native pepper, ginger, coconut, sugar (originated from New Guinea, India was arguably first in its cultivation and processing), plus the later introduced sesame (Africa), nutmeg, cloves, chili peppers (introduced by the Portuguese), etc.

Alcohol was not indigenous.

The Indian culture also often times features a large, extended family and strong bonds in a household.

### Classical Chinese

Some factors that help the development of a sophisticated food culture.
* Access to a variety of materials. Not necessarily the case for Japan.
* Long, stable environment
* Strong tradition of family / household. Chinese filial piety was exemplary in this regard. US much less so.
* Court culture, or patronage from aristocracy, and some social mobility.
* Restaurant culture, as in 19th Century France or modern US.

Shang invaded Xia around the same time as Dorians, Aryans. There seems to be surprisingly similarity between Shang people / artwork and Central American culture of the same time.

Climate was warmer, and millet was predominant, rice and wheat less so.

Zhou, more centralized power, emperor reigns by the mandate of heaven. A bureaucratic class of scholars to rule and spread the culture. The Shi.
Saw the introduction of soybeans, invention of cast iron which facilitated agriculture.

Culture, production, and science flourished.
Schools of thought include Confucianism, with an emphasis on obedience, harmony; knowing one's place; filial piety; explicit manners and ritualization of daily life.
Taoism, harmony with nature, inaction and simplistic lifestyle.

The pursuit of longevity.

Qin. The first empire. A form of government introduced to last till 20th C.
Replacement of local warlords with bureaucrats.
Unification of measurement, culture, etc.

Han. Confucianism. Imperial college. The meritocracy of scholar bureaucrats.
Trade flourished, exploration went far and wide.
2AD, 6 million people.
Extraordinary level of organization to feed these cities. Agricultural laws. Low tax on land to allow small independent farmers to flourish. Textbooks, encyclopedia on agriculture, officials sent out to teach the populace; public works, granary, irrigation; public relief; state sponsorship of medical research.

Staggering technological enhancement: multiple cropping, methods of irrigation, breeding of animals, storage technique, fertilizers, soil categorization, iron tools, etc.
Soy sauce, pickling techniques, dried meats, noodle technology.
Introduction of the wok and stir frying cooking technique. Iron woks rusted and were not preserved, but clay models survived.

Medical theory, holistic.
Qi, energy, life force. Health depends on Yin and Yang being in harmony.
Earth, fire, wood, metal and water. Organized in a cycle (creation and destruction, processes of change).
Development of acupuncture.

Arguably the most complex culinary tradition on earth.

### Roman

Republican, austere, Mediterranean

Garum from Spain. Fermented fish sauce.

Imperial, exotic luxurious.
Rooster testicles, flamingo tongues, etc.
Social aspirant looking to awe their dinner guests.
Social function of dinner parties.

On Cooking Things.

Gastronomic perversities of the late empire.
Elagabalus camel's heels, tongues of nightingales, heads of peacocks, etc.

### Early Christianity

Jews being the subjects of he empire, with their own puppet king and a Roman governor.
New forms of worship in the synagogue (Greek for school)

Different sects of Judaism, that of John the Baptist; escaping the city and living in communities.

The communion (Eucharist). The supper of Jesus and his 12 disciples (celibration of passover), during which Jesus suggests the bread his flesh and the wine his blood, and asked the disciples to remember him when they dine.

The laws of the Old Testament were altered with the cruxificion of Jesus (Jesus as the scapegoat sacrified to God for our sins). Circumcision, food taboo, being exclusive to the Jewish, etc people were no more.

Secret society. Ecclesia. (Actively persecuted. Paul beheaded during Nero's reign.)
Symbol of a fish.

Absorption of pagan practices to ease the spread of Christianity.

Fasting and asceticism. Subdueing the body's needs nurtures the soul.

The early ascetics lived alone in celibacy, obedience, or silence, later on they adopted a monastic lifestyle. Western monasticism, St Benedict, austerity and penitential.
A resentment to the rest of the world who gets to enjoy these pleasures?

Gluttony has become one of the seven deadly sins.

A salad to curb lust: cold, dry (mallows, tansy, hyssop, parsley), very sparing on the oil and vinegar.

### Dark ages and Charlemagne

450 - 800 dark ages of Western Europe, fall of Rome to the Carolingian Renaissance.

The Germanic peoples, Goths, Franks, Saxons, Jutes, Vandals, etc, overran the depleted empire.
A period where culture is bleak, and as was culinary arts.

Trade shrinked, famine and plague were common. Lack of trade and grain reserve saw a decline in population in Western Europe.

Food culture focused on a return to the wilderness: competitive drinking of beer (rye-brewed served in a horn), lard, butter, meat, curdled milk were often on the menu.

Cook books of the time would focus on roasting meat (barbeque), with barely any mention of spices for a lack of trade.

Grain, wine and oil as required by the Christian communion would be scarce, and white bread became a status symbol (wheat grew in the south and warmer areas), while rye bread (dark and dense, rye grew in the colder north) became commoner's food.
Ergotism, caused by the fungi ergot on the rye bread, also spread.

The Greco/Romano tradition of fast and feasting were also replaced.

The reign of Charlemagne, both as a Germanic and Christian king saw a combination of Christian dieting / moderation and Germanic feasting. Food trade laws were instated, and agricultural Capitularies (royal edict) were issued to encourage planting vegetables and fruit, and digging fish ponds.
This period also saw the domestication of oats.

The organization of land owning lords (counts) and serfs working the land also saw rise to Feudalism.

In general, Western Europe in this period did not have the preconditions for a sophisticated food culture.

### Islam

Religion of the Bedouin, nomadic warrior / trader society in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.

The prophet Mohammed was a merchant, married to a wealthy widow and served as her financial adviser.

The development of Islam had clear Jewish and Christian influence.
Islam (submission to the will of God) being the last and most complete of Abrahamic religions with simpler and more accessible accounts. E.g. explicit pictures of heaven and its pleasures; also the Quran being the mouthpiece of one person, it offers fewer conflicting accounts.
Islam features no ascetic traditions, except certain sects.
There is general appreciation for the arts, except creating image of God / idolatry.

Hijrah, 622, the journey of the prophet to Medina. Year in which the Islamic calendar begins.

Halal food (no pig or blood, properly prepared, no meat offered to pagan Gods.)

Islam forbids alcohol but throughout time this seems only obeyed by the most devout.
Coffee then becomes popular in place of alcohol. Popularization of coffee houses and 16C onwards, communal hookah.
Roasted coffee beans and drinking coffee thick would be a Turkish tradition.

The month of Ramadan is a pillar of Islam, during which no eating or drinking is allowed during daylight.
People eat with 3 fingers of right hand, usually sitting on the floor. Flatbread + tray of food.

The tradition of sharing food with strangers at your door became adopted, symbolizing hospitality and equality. Although certain sects only dine with muslims.

Elite food include dates, mutton, camel's milk (sheep tail fat in particular).

Islamic golden age saw the preservation of Greco/Roman work, later to be reintroduced to Europe.
Arguably for the first time real expansion on Greek thoughts.

Jews-Muslim animosity would also be a fairly late development.

Persian culture was largely absorbed, including its preference for young meats (roasted / fried in butter, served with sugar / syrup / crushed nuts / creamy, and slowly cooked over low fire. Usually marinated)

Islamic culinary arts were also accomplished in sweets / pastry / ice cream.
The same period also saw advancement in agriculture technology, irrigation and medicine.

### High middle ages and the international Gothic cuisine

Norse influence.
Global warming and population boom before the Bubonic plagues starting 1348.
Danish cook book.

Banquet, cookbooks focusing on handling meat.

Bubonic plague started in late 14th Century in Southern Europe. Black rats were hosts, and fleas the vessel whose bite transmitted the disease to human. The plague became widespread in Europe within a year, killing off a third of its population.
The last major plague was the Justinian plague of 6th Century.
Accompanied it was a time of famine.

It is believed, however, that the depopulation caused the living conditions of peasants in the coming generations to improve.
Culinary arts became more widespread among the commoners, or soon-to-be middle class townsfolks.
The trade cities of Italy and northern Europe flourished soon afterwards.

Surviving French cookbooks of the late 14th and 15th Century mentioned methods to prepare meat (which seemed to favor a large quantity to spices, to flavor food and show wealth) in large scale banquets as well as in common households.
