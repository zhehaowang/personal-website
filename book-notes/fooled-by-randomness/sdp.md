### Tips

* Take lots of pictures
* Try different viewpoints
* Travel light
* Learn your camera, learn to use fill flash and bounce flash (flash isn't just for dark spaces)
* Use your pictures, post online, build a portfolio
* Know your final format (how it's going to be used, size, horizontal, vertical, aspect ratio)
* Make a great thumbnail
* Get another opinion
Sometimes a photographer's emotions or focus on the technical details of a picture, like sharpness and contrast, can hinder his or her ability to judge the aesthetics that most non-photographers can just feel.
Outside opinions, no matter where they are from, are valuable.
* Edit (the best of) your images
* Make pictures, don't just take them
  * Envision a photograph, find the best location, find the best viewpoint, find the best time, determine how the natural light needs to be adjusted.
  * Hold the camera up, identify the right exposure, perspective, background blur, depth-of-field, press the shutter
  * Edit the picture.
* Evaluate your photography: experience, planning, camera. Get better gears only after you learn how to plan a shot.
* Don't worry so much about the equipment and settings.
* Get an extra battery and SD card.
* Never close an empty door: when you have your SD card / battery out, leave the empty door open so you know you are missing something.

"Be there and think": the subject, the location, the perspective, the lighting, the timing, the weather, the mood, the pose, the clothes, the expression, the composition and the camera settings.

"I'd rather you leave your camera in auto mode than become preoccupied with any one aspect of making a picture, especially the equipment and settings."

### Example subjects

* Still life photography: arrangements / composition; choosing props: symbolism, interaction with light. Good practice for theories.
* Levitation photography, editting trick
* Multiple exposures, silhouette one picture on (the dark portrait in) another

### Composition

What do you want to convey? What is the story you are trying to tell?
What is your subject, and what are some visual cues in the image?

Some things to consider,
* Rule of thirds, try placing your subject at one third towards an edge
* Rule of space, if the subject is moving or looking towards a direction, leave space in that direction such that the picture does not seem crowded
* Focal point, you might see a gorgeous landscape around you, but without a focal point, the picture will come out boring as the eye disregards the scene as background. If you can't find a focal point in a landscape picture, use the sun, ask a friend or yourself to pose. The idea is to try creating an anchor in the image for the eyes to rest upon
* Simplifying / subtraction: did you include anything in the frame that would distract the eyes?
* Angle of view, choose your fore/background, depth of field (lens focal length, f stop, distance to subject, flash). Some things to consider: foreground as a stepping stone to introduce the subject. Or if you want to convey isolation, maybe the foreground would be too much of a distraction.
* Showing scale: you may lose the scale of your subject with too much simplification. If you need to show the scale of your subject, include something of known size.
* Leading lines, they don't have to be straight, towards the subject you want the audience to focus on. What if you don't have them: can you have objects placement that would help cue / balance the image?

* symmetry,

* scan the edges of the frame: did you get something you don't want (the camera and our eyes may see things differently, whereas our eyes may filter out the unwanted in an image, the camera would capture them faithfully)? Do your subjects require a little more headroom?

### Portraits

* The subject of a portrait is rarely the entire person, but instead their facial expression, and you should consider cropping around the face.


# Adobe Lightroom

* Exposure, exposure compensation on camera
* Adjusting highlights down can sharpen the details
* Shadow
* White and black clips the histogram
* Vibrance, saturation can bring out the color
* Noise reduction, sharpening
* Sensor dust (spot removal)
* Copy settings to other pictures

* Wildlife / portrait, if you didn't catch the eye, you didn't take the shot
