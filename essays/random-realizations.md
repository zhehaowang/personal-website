# Random realizations, quotes from conversations with friends

Although we are young, and the cost of making sub-optimal choices is relatively small, but with each choice there still is a cost.
Now that I think of it, miss the chance to go to Tsinghua / CMU / Google / ... once, we probably miss it for life.
The impact magnifies over time, leading one down different paths in life...maybe diverging farther from the goal we set out to achieve, if there ever were one.
At some point one settles down, becomes satisfied and loses the mettle.
When that day comes, I just want to reassure myself I did everything I could, and worked hard for everything I believed right.

Some say for portrait sketching, it takes three months learning from a teacher, to command the same amount of skills as one would learn by oneself in three years.
Skimming through some MIT open courses left me with the impression: you may not have realized how far you may already be behind those younger than yourself.
Of course one should account for some level of hindsight bias: knowing what you know now and what would have helped, it's easy to be biased in your judgment of how valuable the content is.
Yet it is impossible to experience the counterfactual.
My hope is to gauge the future, through experience and introspection, such that we can commit to what's important, and hopefully, not to be left with a feeling that we may already be very much behind.
This very well should mean stepping out of the comfort zone and taking on the things we were systematically bad at: overcoming the fear of communicating with someone whom we deem more accomplished than ourselves, not indulging the inclination to sulk and ponder by ourselves, the tendency of avoiding (monetary) cost and taking an organized and disciplined approach towards our work.
Also this would suggest do things effectively: in learning, building software, exercise, etc.

Perhaps the status of an immigrant in this country helps in this regard, as well as being in the company of many elites: we are near constantly reminded of how much we need to improve, and what might go wrong if we become laxed in our efforts.
It would not be end of the world if such were not to be, but we should nonetheless give it our best on what we deemed worthy.

At a game, as well as at other things: a big difference is whether there is a purpose in mind.
Today Iâ€™ve a goal to improve my skills.
What do I want to learn and internalize today? How do I achieve that? Did I manage to achieve it?

There were times in games when I thought "why don't you noobs get good", then I realized it's just different life priorities.
Some play to have fun, others play to win.
I'm in the middle of figuring out why I play, and along that process we found a few things that might make a difference.
Now is just as good a time as any to do those.

After a while the absurd becomes the norm: hour-long build times, non-existent coding convention, hideous undefined behaviors floating around, dependency loops, and the like.
The silent desperation takes over, and one starts to think it must be the same everywhere else, and not worth the trouble to seek changes.
This, too, unfortunately, is what comes with experience.
Zoom in, zoom out, don't lose sight of what we set out to achieve, and embrace changes.
On how we do things, and more importantly, on how I perceive them and take them on.

With travel comes change, habits uprooted and reestablished.
We may fear losing the key initiatives / inspirations / insights we just had, or simply fear the unknown.
It is at such moments we should reiterate the core values we believed in, what we set out to achieve, stay confident in who we are, and seek opportunities within the changes.

The difference often comes from that final push, one that goes just beyond the critical mass, and tips the balance in your favor.
One can give up thinking the tasks all but impossible, or complain about the inability of others.
Yet know that more often than not failure comes from one's own resolve falling short, or one's inexperience in seeing the merits and contributions of others.

Much like the time-value of money, using which we discount future cashflows to derive a present value, there is a time-value of knowledge / skills / achievements (meta-physically, all assets) as well.
Different branches of knowledge have instrinsically different discount curves, mapped to a multi-dimensional space of evaluation criteria.
The key would then lie in identifying the critical path, and giving it all you got, now.

You should know when to stop. And when you are about to stop, push one step further.
You never know if just one step would make all the difference if you don't take it.

The biggest asset of a company, or perhaps any human construct, is its people.
Make sure they are treated as such, and make sure they are given the right environment and resources to realize their potentials.

Looking at my documents since 2013 there are at least three dozen named notes, thoughts, realizations, plans and the like.
Most of them are scratches, mind dumps, and early studies that never came to fruition.
They struck me with the realization that almost none of my ideas now is completely new.
They all trace back to somewhere, although the source may seem long forgotten.
Work on your bookkeeping, taxonomy, and consolidate often.

Learn like you will not be able to tomorrow.
That may actually happen.

Do your best to learn from them, rather than be intimidated by them.

Reach out. Ask. Praise. Appreciate. Voice your thoughts.

Right, wrong, good, bad, it's all a matter of perspective.
Keep an open mind. Know and appreciate that your perspective may not be one shared by others.
Question and improve that of your own, realize and appreciate those of others'.


Maybe it's this particular feeling of having one's mind inspired that drew me close as it longed for food for thought. It almost reminds me of an old friend and the way she used to kindle ideas from these ashes.
Come to think of it, perhaps I was naive and biased while she was right all along. In hindsight, perhaps her decisions were for the best and delivered in a very tactful manner, while my thoughts and feelings misguided.

* what I don't do well in
  * convey your thoughts in a confident and clear way. Some fear seems to have been holding us back.
  * I would think I'm not a cynic, not an inconsiderate person, not overly vain and not terrible at certain things, are those merely blissful illusions that the mind chose to weave for me?
  * When to settle for a compromise, and when to aim only for the very best, how we balance?

* Learn something new different every 30, 60, 90, 360 days. Improve in certain ways. Change, forming habits, a conscious influence, and a dedicated effort.

* This mind seems to have lost some of its most treasured liveliness / creativity / imagination / daringness / humor, could one blame it on the burden of real life? Did things really take a downturn since this job? What exactly is this burden? Immigration? Work? Future? Desire for a breakthrough? Routine? Is this something we should actively work to thwart?

* Our perspectives are often shaped by the limited knowledge and experience we have. We take what we are used to for granted, and any development longer than the lifespan or the radius of a human being can be hard for the particular being to comprehend. Realize this and keep an open mind. (Sapiens, Languages)

* First try to make progress, then seek breakthroughs. Are you running away from your problems? What better time than now to face and overcome them?

* Much like a civlization, an individual goes through periods of rise and fall / ebb and flow. Some started out brilliant at school, early on in their career, but later see their talents and potentials buried in the daily routine, shackled by tradition. Keep a mindset of change and growth, and enjoy the process.

* Probablistic, statistical

* The unstructured life is not worth living, for some.

* Things we are systematically bad at
  * Communicating with those who we deemed superior
  * Balancing digging and asking
  * Getting your questions answered
  * Interacting in a group
  * Acknowledging our shortcomings, being wrong, being open and frank about our weakness and that we are confused, appearing smart / knowledgeable / superior

* De javu and is math useful? is math olympiad useful?

* Is skepticism trying to take the easy way out?

* Know the level you need to know at, and one level lower

* We've had more than our share of documents with questions and answers, plans and schedules. We should perhaps focus on why they did not achieve what they meant to, as a start, I think we need to be very specific with our questions, and be systematic in answering them / getting them answered.

* MIT is difficult. Few things worthwhile are not. Taking on these challenges is, too, how you escape your comfort zone.

* Each of us carries inside an ideal, a craving, an agenda. Something buried in us early on in our journey. By appealing to which we are most easily swayed. What is it that we seek? Is it acknowledgment, power, friendship, wealth, chivalric virtues, intellectual connections, to excel, leisure, thrills and adventures, love and attention, sensory pleasures, among many? Whatever we seek, know that
  * we do not expect it to remain constant in the days to come, hence we should be constantly on the lookout / introspection
  * it is likely a compound of multiple dimensions and factors intertwined
  * this craving could shape our perspective, so much as to cast ludicrous lights upon those of others. Observe, gather evidence, reason from first principles i.e. our nature, don't assume prematurely, and don't judge. One is not necessarily more noble than another. Us of this age and living in this culture are perhaps sorely lacking in such aspects, that self expression and individualism are much better developed than the skill and patience of observation. We cannot live the past, thus all the more reason to know and to reflect. We each are given a golden apple and a choice to make, and youth perhaps is that apple. One can argue Paris did make the best choice.

* Challenge of canon and should a Stoic apatheia be pursued? Is it beneficial to be attached, or devoted? Can certain aspects be experienced only if such dedication is present? Is this something that can be measured by a utilitarian analysis on the tradeoff?

* Pursuit of one's nature perhaps is over-romanticised: what we deem as our nature could be particular and sometimes accidental marks left on us, especially at a young and impressionable age. For example, the nearly taken-for-granted distrust towards communism of people born and raised in this land. The rejection of such "natural" precepts, or the realization that our nature (as well as the ground that nurtured it) is evolving and those of others at a different time or place can often times be near impossible to gauge, opens up room for progress and learning, and argues for maintaining an open, active and understanding mind. Such perhaps is the challenge on our canon.

* The time factor is often easily overlooked: for now the company may be productive with everyone working remotely, yet this could have been the result of spending the social and bonding credit that people built up over time. Similarly, our mind perhaps is wired in ways that make it easier to appreciate instant gratification (as pertain to the immediate question of the individual's survival, thousands of years past), and it would take guidance, wisdom, and discipline to convince it of benefits of a longer term. And it shall be such that we seek to provide to our mind: be ready to answer whether your actions today is spending the credit in your health and energy, or contributing to it? Whether the habits you follow now will see something distinctive and beautiful blossom in the years to come, or quite the contrary?

* Ultimately, one is alone and has one's own best judgment to answer for. The states of being convinced otherwise are ephemeral. Do not willingly drown oneself in such vain hopes or temptation, and lose that judgment.
