# A Promised Land

Description of Obama's state senate runs, senate run, presidential campaign, and during his presidency: subprime mortgage crisis handling, TARP, withdrawal from Iraq, increased military in Afghanistan, H1N1 response, Wall Street regulation, healthcare act, immigration DREAM act, Israeli settlement of the West Bank, Greek debt crisis, Russia, China and Iran, environment commitments, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, midterm election and losing housing, Bin Laden.

The division today had not been the norm.
House and Senate Republican and Democrats were not expected to mostly vote strictly on party lines decades ago.
Nor is today's Republican party any similar to that of Lincoln's, and little does today's Democratic party resemble that of the time of Southern Democrats.

Republican today is conservative, favors tax cut, reduced regulation and government spending, tightened immigration, anti universal healthcare, bailouts.
With a dangerous tendency of leaning towards populism, with Sarah Pailin as running mate in 2008, and an attention-seeking Trump already being the leading Republican in 2012.
It is perhaps no surprise that repeatedly demagogues would rise in a democratic society.

It's a complicated process of give and take. Making compromises such that progress is still possible.
It's quite conceivable the political decision makers are by no means knowledgeable on the subject they are ruling.
The subject matters themselves are often unprecedented (in details), and consequences of action are hard to gauge. 
Being pressured by constituents, donors and lobbyists, few perhaps could make the right decision, even if there were to be one that is perceived to be beneficial in the long run to the vast majority.

As an example, mandatory vaccination as a response to a potential pandemic: 1976 Ford government mandatory vaccination for an exaggerated pandemic threat. Were the due dilligence overlooked and ordinary people sacrificed for a political agenda, in this case an ultimately failed reelection attempt?

The biggest blocker in legislation had been congressional filibuster: where even a Democratic majority cannot pass laws.
To avoid something being put on pause indefinitely, sixty votes are needed.
Each bill then need a couple Republican votes and a guarantee of all the Democratic votes. And doing so often means catering to the demands of this particular minority, making compromises that often anger the more radical members of the house.

Voters seek change in the White House, and are more often than not disappointed in the newly elected government to bring about promised changes. This is reflected in the majority party losing the House in the first midterm.
The loss in 2010 was drastic.

With all the woes of contemporary American society aside, the promise of democracy, freedom, rule of law, reinforced by the separation of powers, is still a powerful one, and perhaps more ambitious in scale than any our species previously tried.
It is worth striving for, knowing full well the uphill battles awaiting.

His was perhaps a life fitting that of the active Stoic teaching of the past.
