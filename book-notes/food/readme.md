# History of food

### Stone age cooking

Gatherer hunters

We gather more than we hunt. Just that the bigger bones stick around more easily

Sea people move less than inland people.
Colder arctic areas generally have less variety in their diet.

### Early agriculturalists

Why did agriculture, or the domestication of plants come about?

A combination of accidents (storing food underground and seeing them grow), need (the food source that a group used to rely on becomes no longer available), and its ability to stably sustain larger amount of people. (As their gathering / society being more successful, the natural selection process passed the genes and habits of these collections of people on.)

Agriculture was not present among native Australians, Amazonians, etc, perhaps for lack of need for agriculture, or the lack of suitable plants to domesticate.

Suitable usually meaning a starch-based plant, wheat (Eurasia), rice (Asia), sorghum (Africa), potato (Americas), corn (Americas), quinoa (Americas).
First cultivation of wheat was found in the middle east. Syria, Israel, east Turkey, etc.

Domestication of animals followed suit. Dogs, sheep, goats, cattle (herding animals, usually herbivores) were among the first ones domesticated, and they were rarely bred for food, for dairy, utility, etc.

Indus river valley area perhaps saw the first domestication of chicken, usually bred for the eggs.

Pigs were domesticated at a later stage (except in China), due to its lack of utility to the early civilization: they don't eat grass, cannot be milked, etc, and can only provide meat.

Civilizations more reliant on dairy typically develops luctose tolerance.

Civilizations have long depended on benign bacteria for dairy, wine, bread, etc, and evolved along with those that cause disease.
The aboriginal people aren't as exposed to the disease Eurasians carry, and e.g. Meso-Americans, Tasmanians, people of the Canary Islands died in droves upon first contact with Europeans.

### Egypt

Earliest agricultural civilization. 4000BC Sumer, Iraq. Akkadian. Whose 1600BC work was the earliest written recipes.
A set of cities like Ur, Uruk, etc.

Egypt, physical and archaeological evidence of domestication, agriculture, recipes, etc.

Tigris and Euphrates are unpredictable rivers and Sumerians developed irrigation.
Over time the soil becomes over salinized, and the surrounding plains made the cities subject to invasions.

Nile, on the other hand, floods very predictably each year. Nile flood plain remains fertile to this day, and the surrounding desert provides protection.

Extensive trade network. To Nubia, Greece, and Semitic peoples.

Grains, emmer (predecessor of wheat), barley (a symbol of resurrection), beans.
The state has grain storage, and use grain as exchange.
Beer drinking habits. Brewed wine.
Raised bread and use of yeast. Cone shaped loaves. Bad teeth from saddle quern grinding technique.

Game meat.
Beef and a large scale cattle industry. (the goddess Hathor)
Boiled meat.
Sacred bulls for the priests, reincarnation of the god Apis, and delivers prophecy, mummified afterwards.
Seemed to eat pork but avoided pork later, and pigs are forbidden to be used in sacrifices.
Domesticated chicken not until Ptolemaic time.
Salted fish.

Lettuce, cabbage, cucumbers, a wide variety of beans (lentils, chickpeas), lotus.
Papyrus.
Spices like cumin, mustard.
Sesame oil, imported olive oil. Animal fats for cooking.

Egyptians were well fed, and many over-ate. Alcoholism among priests.
Malnutritions Intestine worms from walking in the river.

Food buried in tombs with mummies.

No universal rigid food restrictions. Priests might have.

### Ancient Judea

Old Testament, mythological version of real events.

Eden. Adam and Eve. Fruit eaters. All killing is wrong.

Punishment for disobedience: labor. Gain your food from hardship.

Caine and Abel. Farmer and shepherd.
Punishment: wander the earth alone with a mark to be kept alive, land will not produce for him. A nomadic different from that of the Judean people.

Noah. Sacrifice to God. After which God claims all living creatures are food for you. But he wants justice from murder / killing (scapegoat).
Only dietary restriction: can't eat blood.

**Passover** (March/April). Moses and Israelites in Egypt.
Derived from smearing blood on your household, such that God does not take away the firstborn of the Judean household, but only those of Egyptians.

Food traditions derived from the exodus (no raised bread, etc).

Later on more food traditions are added: recline as opposed to sitting straight. Four glasses of wine, etc.
This has to do with a time when Israel was under Greek occupation. 

The Promised Land, given ten commandments, and how to perform sacrifice.

Dietary restriction of the Hebrews:
* **kosher animal**: anything that "chews the cud" (vegetarian animals) and has a completely split hoof is ritually clean, but those animals that only chew the cud or only have cloven hooves are unclean.
  * Camel, pigs, hare, etc, are then not clean. Nor is shellfish, snails, snakes, bats, or fish without scale.
* They need to be slaughtered in a certain way.
* Nor are certain culinary methods allowed: mixing milk and the meat of the animal (e.g. cheeseburger).

The Book of Leviticus also introduces the following:
* The tradition of fasting.
* **Rosh Hashanah** (September/October), Jewish new year.
* The Sabbath. Seventh day of the week, commanded by God as a holy day of rest. The year of Jubilee.
* Tithe. One tenth of all produce to support priests.

Under Saul, David and Solomon, the Jewish people conquered its neighbors.

The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Assyrians then later Babylonians, which induces an age of prophets. Destruction of the 1st temple.

Under the Persians Jews were allowed to return. Construction of the 2nd temple.
And then Greeks took over and the old testament ended. **Hanukkah**(December) derived from a revolt against the Seleucids in this period.

Romans then took over. Destruction of the 2nd temple. Worships happen at each household.

### Greece

Presumably mountainous terrain making it hard to get somewhere via land led to flourishing sea trade.

And lack of arable land made it hard to feed a large population, and contributed to Greek colonization of west of Turkey, south of Italy (magna graecia), Sicily, south of France (Marseille), east of Spain, and the Black Sea / Ukraine.

The hilly terrain was suitable for olive trees and vineyards.
Long summers.
Goods for trade. Enriched a class of citizens that patronizes philosophy, arts and gastronomy.

Homer's work in which heroes favored beef. The bigger the animal, the better. (Pastures are rare.)

Public festivals. Different cults.
Dionysian cult and its similarity with Christian analogy bread and wine.
Drama tradition and loss of self identity in Dionysian ecstasy.

Pythagoras vegetarian.

Symposium as a social gathering of people eating and then drinking / telling stories, not in the Platonic sense.

Plato would value ideals and thoughts over secular desires such as food, a distraction from the important pursuits.
This "food guilt" / preference may have left a trace throughout western civilization, later magnified by Christian teaching.

Part of Archestratus's cookbook survived till today. Written in verses mostly on fish, presumably to be read at symposiums.
Simplicity over complexity, emphasis on where the fish came from.

Fresh milk (and butter) is rarely eaten by Greeks (barbarians do), presumably having to do with its being hard to preserve in warm weather. They make cheese instead.
