Hi there!

My name is Zhehao.

My full-time job is to develop software that trade stocks, in a company based in New York City.

I've a passion for everything engineering, and love to ponder about knowledge, conduct, cultures and life in general (duh).

I recently took an interest in photography and traveling (like everyone else does ‾\\_(ツ)_/‾).

I spent my spare time learning about philosophy and linguistics lately.

My resolution for 2020 is to get enough sleep.
