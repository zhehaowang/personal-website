# Language

Language is not the same as communication / imitation (the latter animals can do but the former seems unique to homo sapiens).

A gradual evolution 100k years ago.

Chomsky hypothesis: language is something we are genetically programmed with, as opposed to culture, society-specific phenomenon.
As speaking a language is not particular to certain areas but all humans do.
Also the ability to learn new languages degrade as one gets older, another characteristic of something a species is genetically programmed to do.

There are over 6000 spoken languages and over 200 written. A language can have only three verbs where they say "do a sleep"; it may use clicks (Bantu languages of Botswana and Namibia) where having one to four clicks before a word mean different things; it may have one word that others mean in a long sentence.

### Language change over time

The writing changes slower, and the sound changes happen faster, typically in following ways:
* Assimilation, least effort to make the different sounds. Example being inpossibilis in Latin to impossibilis, as m is closer to the following p. 
* Consonant devolve: they become softer or omitted over time. Examples being Latin into French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian. The change of t and d, k and g, removal of consonant sound, etc. aqua (Latin) --> agua (Spanish) --> eau (French).
* Vowel devolve and shift over time.
The Great Vowel Shift, starting in the 13th Century, the vowels shifted "up". ah --> ay. name as nahmeh to its modern day pronouciation is a result of this shift, and devolve the last vowel.
Modern written English still reflects how the language was pronounced before the shift: oo as in food was a long ou but now an u, feed was an ae but now i.

The language we speak today also shifts, e.g. aw --> ah in some areas. They started out as accents and gradually the general populace talk in different ways.
Meaning of words, too, shift: awesome and lame in the 60s vs now.

With the sounds devolving over time a language does not become fumbling of vowels over time, as new words are constantly being created.

Some languages work with tones, others suffixes prefixes.
Tones presumably could have come from words devolved over time. Imagine "pa", "pas", "pak" meaning different things in a language, over time the consonant devolves and the only thing differentiating these would be tone.

Grammatical words and concrete words.
Over time concrete ones devolve into grammatical ones. Example being the French pas, where it used to be that ne by itself means negation, and pas had a concrete meaning of "a step", like il ne marche pas used to mean he doesn't walk a step. Over time this concrete meaning devolved and pas was appended meaning general negation with ne.
ne can be downplayed in Spoken French, imagine someone else transcribing this language they can derive the impression that pas alone means negation.
