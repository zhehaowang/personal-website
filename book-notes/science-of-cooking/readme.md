# Science of cooking

### Elements of taste

* salty, to keep internal salt level balanced
* sweet, indicating easy to digest
* bitter, potentially harmful, danger alert
* sour, acids, source of vitamin C, or has gone bad
* umami, (鲜), protein indication
* fatty, indicating rich energy

### Maillard reaction

Chemical reaction starting at 140 C / 284 F between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its distinctive flavor. (fuse / new flavor and aromatic substances.)
Seared steaks, crispy fish skin, fried dumplings, cookies and other kinds of biscuits, breads, toasted marshmallows, and many other foods undergo this reaction.

Since this happens beyond boiling point of water, the surface moisture needs to be driven off by heat first.

Intensifies (twice as quickly) at 150 C / 302 F, peaks at 160 C / 320 F.

**Pyrolysis** (burning) starts at 180 C / 356 F, food chars and becomes bitter.
Carbs, proteins, and then fat breaks down, leaving harmful substance.

### Pairing

Each food has characteristic flavor compounds, the chemicals that lend it its aroma, pungency, and taste.

Shared flavor compounds can often serve as basis for pairing (roasted beef with onion / wheat / butter / beer / peanut butter / mushrooms / coffee).

However, the theories do not account for a food's texture and don't always hold true for Asian and Indian cuisines, where spice combinations have very few or no flavor links.

### Knives

Material
* carbon steel
* stainless steel (with chromium)
* ceramic

Collection
* Serrated knife (Foods that have a tough crust or smooth, delicate skin, such as bread, cake, or large tomatoes where precision isn’t required.)
* Chef's knife (Finely slicing, dicing, disjointing large cuts of meat, and crushing garlic cloves with the side of the blade.)
* Paring knife (Slicing, peeling, coring, and delicate work such as stripping out vanilla beans.)
* Carving knife (Making thin cuts of meat from a large cut.)

### Pots and pans

Material
* Stainless steel (conducts heat poorly, food sticks easily.)
* Copper (heavy and expensive, conducts heat well, reacts to acid and needs coating.)
* Aluminum (conducts heat quickly and loses heat quickly off stove, lightweight, has coating)
* Carbon steel (heats up faster than stainless, but reacts to acid and rusts.)
* Cast iron (Very heavy, cast iron is dense and heats slowly, but, once heated, it retains heat well and is ideal for browning meat in a skillet or casserole. Also reacts with acid so season it, coat with protective nonstick seal and clean carefully. Avoid abrasive cleaners.)

**Pan's thickness**: the thicker the base, the more evenly the heat from the burner spreads across it.

Collection
* Wok
  * Stir-frying over the hottest flame, steaming, and deep-fat frying.
  * A tight-fitting lid, a thin base, and long sturdy handle. Avoid nonstick, which won’t tolerate high stir-frying heats. Carbon steel is ideal; to season it, scrub off the existing oil coat, heat to blacken, add oil to smoke, then rub off the oil when cool. Do this 3–4 times before use.
* Cast-iron skillet
  * Root veg, meats, sticky foods (if seasoned), putting under the broiler and in the oven.
  * A long, heat-proof handle (cast iron retains heat) and a grip handle to aid in lifting.
* Round casserole dish
  * Slow-braising meats.
  * A tight-fitting lid and easy-to-grasp handles. Although heavy, cast iron is ideal because it keeps a steady temperature, and an enamel interior is durable and doesn’t react with acids.
* Saucepan
  * Sauces, stews, soups, stocks, boiling vegetables, rice, and pasta.
  * Lids to retain moisture, and an extra small-grip handle on large pans to aid in lifting. Heat-proof handles are oven-friendly.
* 10in / 24cm frying pan
  * Delicate fish, eggs, and crêpes.
  * A thick base and thick nonstick coat—choose from a reputable supplier.
* 12in / 30cm saute pan
  * Searing and frying large batches; creating sauces and large meals.
  * A tight-fitting lid to hold moisture, a long handle, and a moderately heavy base.

### Utensils

Tools. (Not every invention is a step forwards—pay attention to how versatile it is and how the material works with different ingredients.)

* Measuring cup
* Digital scale
* Honing steel
* Rolling pin
* Balloon whisk
* Grater
* Metal sieve
* Slotted spoon
* Ladle
* Metal spatula (Sliding under delicate food)
* Thermometer (Look for one with a probe that can rest in a pan. Those that read to 410 F (210 C), can also be used for caramelizing sugar.)
* Rubber spatula (Delicate work)
* Wooden spoon (easy on the surface, poor conductor of heat, but it's a porous material and needs thorough cleaning!)
* Mixing bowl (Stainless steel lasts a long time, but can't be put in a microwave. Tempered glass is heat-resistant and microwave-friendly. Ceramic and stoneware can chip, are slow to warm, so ideal for working with dough.)
* Chopping board (Durable and good for all foods, wooden boards have "give" so they don't dull knives, unlike granite and glass. Plastic traps bacteria in grooves, while wood has bacteria-killing tannins, making it a hygienic choice.)

### Meat and poultry

All made of the same three tissues, varying proportions determine flavor and texture and its best culinary usage.
* Muscle.
  * Red or pink in color and makes up the bulk of most cuts of meat. 70 to 85 percent water—moisture that needs to be conserved to keep cooked meat juicy.
  * Made of thousands of hair-width strands, packed with moisture and protein.
  * Tender cuts need minimal cooking to retain moisture. Marbled muscle can be cooked slowly.
* Fat.
  * Usually tucked under the skin, along connective tissue, or around organs.
  * Chewy, bland and tasteless when uncooked, but imparts huge amounts of flavor when the fat cells burst open during cooking.
  * Each fat cell contains a droplet of oil which bursts open when heated, dissolving flavor molecules and giving meat a moist mouthfeel.
* Connective tissue.
  * Forms sheathes around muscle fibers and connects muscles to bone — it slowly breaks down during cooking, imparting rich flavor to meat dishes.
  * Made of protein that soften and break down when heated to 126 F / 52 C.
  * Long slow cooking transforms it into velvety gelatin, giving meat its succulence.

Know your white meat
* Chicken
  * Fat medium, protein high
  * Not high in fat, so it has a dry mouthfeel if overcooked. Cooking it in a sauce can help to introduce moisture.
* Duck
  * Fat medium, protein medium
  * Rich, dark duck meat has a thick layer of fat under the skin. Roasting, frying, or grilling works best; prick or score the skin first to help the fat melt.
* Turkey
  * Fat low, protein high
  * With lots of muscle and little fat, white turkey meat is good for stir-frying and grilling. The dark leg meat contains more connective tissue and can be stewed.

Choosing your white meat
* Breast meat should be firm and plump.
* Bones should be in-tact, not broken.
* Flesh should be blemish-free.
* The skin should be smooth and soft.

Know your red meat
* Beef
  * Fat high, protein medium
  * A cow's large endurance muscles produce dark, rich meat that suits both slow and fast cooking methods. Cuts that contain muscle marbled with fat will be more succulent.
* Lamb
  * Fat medium, protein medium
  * Fat provides lambs with their day-to-day fuel, so most cuts are marbled with fat. Lamb is suited to most methods of cooking, but the sinewy shoulder and leg cuts need to be cooked down slowly.
* Pork
  * Fat high, protein lowest
  * Ranging from pale pink to rose, pork cuts often have a thick layer of fat that helps keep the meat moist when cooking. Lean fillets and steaks require fast cooking methods to stop them from drying out.
* Venison
  * Fat low, protein high
  * As deer are ranging animals, deer meat contains more muscle and connective tissue than fat. Braise or stew small, lean cuts to conserve moisture, or roast large cuts, which will have a lot of connective tissue.

Choosing your red meat
* Fat enhances flavor. A yellow hue simply suggests the animal was grass-fed.
* The surface should be smooth and not appear sticky or slimy, which could suggest bacteria have proliferated on the surface.
* Meat should have a mild but not unpleasant smell.
* For tender cuts, choose one with a fine grain and little connective tissue. For tough cuts, the grain will be thicker, indicating the muscle was well-used.
* For stewing, look for cuts with fat and connective tissue.
* Marbling is a good sign that meat is full of flavor.

Color of the meat alone is not a reliable indicator of its quality.
* The natural color of meat comes from a red oxygen-carrying pigment, myoglobin, stored in the muscle tissue.
* The higher the levels of myoglobin, the darker and redder the meat, while lower levels of myoglobin result in paler meat.
* Red meat contains myoglobin more than white and older animals have higher levels, giving their meat a darker hue.
* The same animal may have varying levels of myoglobin in different muscles.
  * Dark "slow-twitch" muscles, like those in a leg, are for endurance and need a steady oxygen supply, so have more myoglobin. Whiter "fast-twitch" muscles, for short bursts of energy, need less oxygen, such as chicken breast muscles, designed for flapping wings.
  * Proportions of light and dark meat affect flavor and texture. Darker, well-exercised muscles tend to have more protein, fat droplets, iron, and flavor-generating enzymes. (generally higher levels intensifying flavor and lower levels creating a blander-tasting meat. Light meat needs extra flavoring. As animal grows myoglobin levels rise, muscles strengthen, and fat increases, adding to flavor.)
* Vacuum-packed meat deprived of oxygen has a natural purple tinge.
* Once in contact with air, myoglobin changes color, turning meat bright red. (If it stays purple, this suggests that the animal may have been stressed at slaughter and its meat will be dry and firm.)
* Myoglobin browns the longer it is exposed to oxygen.
* Red liquid pooling at the bottom of a package of meat isn't blood, but a mix of myoglobin and water.

##### Does organic matter?

Animals that have had enough exercise, have been well fed, and have been spared undue stress produce meat that has lots of well-textured muscle and flavorsome fat. Organic-status meat should help guarantee all of these things.
* Animals are raised on organic land and eat organic feed; however, this has little bearing on the quality of meat.
* Animals reared organically aren’t given antibiotics or growth-promoting hormones, although this is already the case for all cattle in many countries.
* Organic stock are more likely to have been slaughtered humanely, which produces better-quality meat. If an animal is stressed preslaughter, adrenaline levels surge, burning energy and producing dry, firm, dark meat.
* Being fed grass or grain has more impact on flavor.
  * Grain-fed muscle has more flavorful fat, is less acidic, and contains pleasant-tasting substances called lactones, while grass-fed cows' meat can have a bitter, grassy flavor.
  * Leaner grass-fed cows store their fat just under the skin. The meat of grain-fed cows tends to be well-marbled throughout.
  * Grass-fed cows have to work harder for their food, so are smaller and leaner.
  * Although grass-fed meat has less fat, the fat it has contains more essential omega-3s, known for their health benefits, than grain-fed cows. (The amount of omega-3 is low compared to the quantities in foods such as oily fish, but this does give grass-fed meat a slight nutritional edge over grain-fed beef.)
  * Many find grain-fed meat flavorful and tender due to its marbling, which makes it less prone to drying out when cooked. Grain-fed beef is described as having a rich, “beefy” flavor.
* If meat isn’t stored or transported with care, this affects quality. High demand for organic means it can travel far and be stored for a long period of time. A nonorganic farm rearing humanely treated animals slaughtered and sold locally is likely to be superior.

##### Does heritage / breed matter?

Beef has a complex flavor, yet genetic differences lead to only subtle taste variations. Research consistently shows that the amount of marbling in any given cut is more important than the actual breed.

##### Do larger chicken lack flavor?

The modern "broiler" chicken is the result of decades of aggressive selective breeding.

The bird that is industrially farmed today is four times the size of those bred 50 years ago, reaches slaughter weight in just 35 days (less than half the time of traditional breeds), and is plagued with health problems due to its abnormal proportions.

Heritage breeds of chicken take longer to grow and are considerably more expensive, but research shows that the meat has a significantly richer flavor and better mouthfeel than intensively farmed chickens.

Of chicken raised in the US, less than 2 percent are raised organic.

##### Different cuts of beef

* Fillet steak, or filet mignon, is a scarce, highly sought-after commodity. The least-worked section of the least-worked muscle on a cow—the tenderloin along the back.
* Fillet steak is low in fat because the tenderloin muscle doesn’t need much energy.
* We think of saturated fat as bad, but fat helps us to enjoy meat’s full flavor and texture, melting when cooked to make meat juicy and tender, and chemically reacting (or oxidizing) in heat to
generate flavors.
* A lack of fat means that fillet requires very careful cooking to ensure it doesn’t dry out and lose its silky-smooth consistency. If you enjoy meat no more than medium done, a properly cooked fillet is indeed the best cut. However, if you prefer meat medium to well done, other cuts are often more delicious.
* A thicker fillet (4cm) allows the outside to be well browned without overdoing the middle.

* Tenderloin
  * lean, little fat, contains fillet mignon.
  * Scant connective tissue and fat mean fillet needs delicate cooking to prevent drying. Cook no more than medium.
* Sirloin
  * top sirloin, lightly marbled and more tender; bottom sirloin, more marbling and less tender.
  * rich flavor thanks to its succulent fat; cook quickly, medium rare to medium to keep its tenderness.
* T-bone
  * With tenderloin on one side, sirloin on the other, this is highly flavored and with spinal bone that adds flavor.
  * Pan-fry or grill to rare or medium rare.
* Rib-eye
  * Cheaper, less tender, well-used muscle around the ribs.
  * Rich marbling makes it flavorful.
  * Cook to at least medium so fat and connective tissue can soften.
* Rump (buttocks)
  * Less tender than sirloin.
  * Also rich in flavor. Pan-fry fairly quickly, medium rare to medium.
* Chuck
  * Neck and shoulder with tough connective tissue.
  * Cook slowly in liquid to break down the connective tissue to tenderize the meat into succulent gelatin.

* Wagyu is usually highly marbled, which makes their meat wonderfully flavorful and very rich. Enzymes called calpains, which break down and tenderize meat, are particularly active in Wagyu breeds. (A1 - A5 with A5 highest. A5 Wagyu is ruby red and densely textured with glistening ribbons of fat and a smooth, velvety texture.)

##### Signs that water was added

Manufacturers would claim injecting water "wet-cured" / "vacuum tumbled" in briny water helps with flavor, it can as muscle fibers become softer, but it also affects intensity of flavor, resulting in blander meat.

Ingredients containing added or retained water being high on the list indicates water was injected.

##### Does freezing destroy taste and texture

Meat freezes from the outside inward. In home freezers this is a slow process, giving time for sharp-edged ice crystals to form, which gradually get bigger and pierce the muscle’s delicate structure. When thawed, damaged cells lose water and the meat is less juicy and tender.

Chicken e.g. would see a significant drop in quality having been frozen for 12 months.
Beef / pork even shorter.

##### Pound meat or not

Striking a cut of meat with a tenderizing hammer crushes and damages muscle fibers, creating tiny rips in the connective tissue that binds the fibers together.
Puncturing the muscle fibers and tissues in this way actually means that the meat retains 5–15 percent more moisture during cooking because the pounded muscle fibers shrink less, and the damaged proteins in the fibers soak up moisture, giving the meat succulence.

##### Marinating meat

Marinate meat for no longer than 24 hours, and ideally less.
If you marinate meat for too long, the salt in the marinade will actually start to cure the outside of the meat and the outer layers will be mushy when cooked. Marinating meat for just 30 minutes before cooking will have an impact on flavor.

Alkaline ingredients, such as egg whites and baking soda, can accelerate the browning reaction.

During cooking, the sugars and proteins in a marinade help to brown the meat, creating a crisp, flavorful crust.

Marinades don't really infuse meat with flavor.
It is physically impossible for marinades to penetrate far into meat. Most flavor molecules are too large to squeeze into the muscle tissue cells in meat.
This means that oil and flavor molecules infuse no further than a few millimeters into the meat, and instead pool on the surface.

A marinade should include most of the following: salt, a fat, such as oil, an acid ingredient (optional, because it can slow browning), and flavorings, such as sugar, herbs, and spices.
* Salt enhances overall flavor and it also disrupts the structure of the proteins in the top layers of the meat (see opposite), allowing a little moisture to enter and giving meat a more tender texture.
* Fats. Oils, such as olive oil, serve as a base for a marinade, spreading other flavour molecules and helping meat to brown and crisp. Yogurts are traditionally used in Indian marinades. The dairy sugars and proteins interact with those on the meat during cooking to create unique aromatic substances.
* Acidic substance
  * Lemon juice adds a tangy flavor, triggering the bitterness taste buds. It also helps to tenderize the outer layers of meat.
  * Vinegar helps tenderize meat and brings a tartness to a marinade that helps to offset the naturally rich flavor of the meat and the oil or fat in the marinade.
  * This provides tartness and the alcohol helps to disperse other flavors in a marinade. Wine can soften the outer layers of the meat.
* Flavorings
  * Sugar. As well as enhancing flavor, sugar helps to speed browning and also caramelizes. Use honey or corn syrup rather than table sugar.
  * Herbs and spices. Helping to distinguish a marinade as sweet, spicy, sharp, or fresh-tasting. The flavours are extracted when carried in the marinade’s oil.

##### When to salt meat

Salt adds flavor, and soaks up moisture.

Salting meat just before cooking creates a brine layer that can be dabbed off to dry the meat and help it brown more quickly.

Salting meat well in advance of cooking has added benefits. Left for longer, salt starts to tenderize meat by "denaturing" the surface proteins; after about 40 minutes, meat is noticeably softer.

Ground meat should not be presalted.

##### Smoking meat and dry aging at home

##### Cut across the grain, or along it

The "grain" is the direction in which the muscle fibers run.
On a piece of meat, look for the direction of the fibers and lines of connective tissue on the surface. If you tore the muscle, it would split along these grains.

When you cut meat for serving, it should be cut across, not along, the grain.
Biting into meat cut along the grain takes ten times the biting force as chewing across the grain.

##### Crackling pork (skin)

##### Steak

There is usually no need for warming meat to room temperature before cooking.

A seared steak (crusty surface) does not seal moisture inside. In fact the high heat needed to brown the meat's outer layer dries out the inside more quickly.
A seared brown surface does make for a tastier steak.

* Ensure the pan or grill is hot
* Look for thick cuts (<4cm. Finish thicker cuts off in the oven) with good marbling for a moist, flavor filled steak
* Dab with salt and dry 40 minutes before cooking.
* Sear on high heat for a delicious crust and a soft juicy center.
* Flip it often to cook it evenly.
* For extra flavor, add butter at the final stages, spooning it over the steak as it melts.
* Make your sauce in the same pan so gelatin from the meat thickens the sauce.
* Maximize juiciness by resting steak so the juice thickens. (leave the steak to cool in gravy for a few minutes)

* Extra-rare (soft, center temp 54 C, seared for about 1min on each side)
* Rare (center temp 57 C, cooked for about 2.5min)
* Medium rare (63 C, 3.5min)
* Medium (71 C, 5min)
* Well done (74 C, 6min)

##### Slow cooking

* Best for tough cuts of meat with white connective tissue, root vegetables, dried beans and other pulses.
* Lower temperature is better. Muscle fibers cook from 60 C, as the temperature rises, moisture is lost.
* Chewy collagen in tough meat breaks into velvety gelatin takes place between 65 and 70 C
* Gelatin breaks down in the cooking liquid, thickening it and emulsifying flavor-rich fats to create a rich, luscious gravy.

* If needed, brown onions and pan first in a pan, as slow cooking temperature does not reach required for Maillard reaction.
* Avoid removing the lid.
* Add enough liquid to just cover the food

##### How to keep chicken from drying out

* Brining (submerged in salty over night, to force water into uncooked meat)
* Sous vide (cook in airless bag immersed in hot water)
* Adding fats

##### Sauce

* The aim of a sauce is to achieve a smooth consistency that is thicker than water but less dense than the main ingredient.

Thickener (Starch, cream, protein (egg white), food particles (puree, tomato sauce)) + liquids (water, stock, wine, milk, cream)

##### Stock

A stock is an extraction of flavors from fresh ingredients. In near-boiling water, flavor molecules diffuse out of vegetables and meat as they slowly cook.

##### Why safe to eat rare beef, but not chicken or pork

Handling of chicken, compared with larger animals, usually increases chance of cross contamination.
Chickens often harbor dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter.

Poultry should be cooked to at least 74 C and pork to 62 C to kill harmful bacteria.

##### Why do so many foods taste like chicken

Red meats taste distinctive to us, but when we try a white meat for the first time, we often compare it to chicken. The clue is in the type of muscle the animal has (chicken - fast twitch muscle, no endurance required). Many of the animals we eat today derive from a chicken-tasting ancestor.
