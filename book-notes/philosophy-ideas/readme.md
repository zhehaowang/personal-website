# The Great Ideas of Philosophy

Questions of **Knowledge**, **Conduct**, and **Governance**.

### Did the Greeks invent it all

What differentiates the works of Pythagoras, Plato, etc from those of Homer, Sophocles, Confucius, Buddha etc?

In philosophy there is a **critical, disinterested skepticism**, towards the principles we hold, and even mandates of God.
The pursuit would be **wisdom itself**, not wisdom for the sake of something else.
And a philosophical realization made through skeptical analysis and debates would not end with an exclamation mark, but with semicolon.

The Greek civilization of 6 Century BC would not have been more powerful than the Egyptians or Persians, yet the latter were not considered to have laid the foundations of Western civilization.
How developed the thoughts are of a people / country / culture does not necessarily reflect how wealthy / powerful the group is (their ability to solve practical problems and influence others).
Nor would philosophy be the product of a leisurely Hellenistic upper class built upon labor of slaves and indentured servants.
Egyptians and Persians would have been better suited in that regard.

Greek religion tends to have an estrangement: Gods are revered but aloof and indifferent towards our matters.
The fundamental questions of being would not be something you consult the Oracle for, but rather left to reason about by ourselves.
We ourselves need to make order (classification) out of the chaos of this world.
The state would be religious but without a state religion.

Imagine us as puppets made by the Gods with various cords in it, these cords, reflecting pleasure, pain and emotions pull us in different directions.
One cord is sacred and golden, that of reason and calculations. And when one follows this cord, one is virtuous.

(Plato, The Laws)

### Pythagoras and the divinity of number

Abstract transcendance philosophy (vs natural philosophy would be the focus of later Greek / Aristotle philosophy).

Pythagoras, rich family, shrouded in mystery.
Learnt maths (fractions, calendar predicting Nile flood) from his Egyptian travels.
Rumor has it he traveled and taught in Babylon / India.
Spent most of his life traveling, came back to Greece as a governor and founded his sect.
Pythagoras did poorly as a governor. A philosophically-guided state may not be well suited to the brutal reality.

**Cynics** are an important Pre-Socratic philosophical school. Diogenes. Nothing too excess.

**Pythagoreanism**: abstract idea is the ultimate creator of material and physical realities, and that idea is numbers, hence divinity of numbers, in particular 1 (point), 2 (line), 3 (plane), 4 (solid, tetrahedron, special place in Pythagorean teaching), sum is 10, also sacred in Pythagoreanism.
The lawfulness with which we enter social life is based off of numbers.

Also known for his theorem on right angle triangle and (himself / his school's) contribution to discovery of harmonic structure of music (harmony, matches with something in the soul; what creates a harmony is the relationship between notes) (part of the intended design of the cosmos).

Over time we won't exist but rectilinear triangle will, mathematical abstractions will, and will remain correct, precise in describing the relationships in physical world.

Also believes in transmigration of souls, death liberates something in us.

Pi, e, sqrt(-1) has no place in Pythagoreanism?

Sophia, wisdom itself; and Pythagoras considered himself a philosopher, as he strived to and have befriended wisdom itself.

Elegance and simplicity expressed in mathematical, formulaic equation.

### What is there (metaphysics)

A metaphysical question.

Real object, perception and distortion, what is beyond there.

If our senses (always) lie, how would we know reality.

Aristotle notes that they have just completed a systematic consideration of nature / the physical world, and what is natural.

Centuries later people notes his work after the physics treatise as metaphysics: after the physics / natural science work.

**Metaphysics** deals with the subject of real existence.
* What is there: **ontology** (being, the branch of metaphysics that deals with reality and existence. After change, does the original still exist? Cause and effect. Are there minds and thoughts, or just peculiar states of the brain, are they merely terms hankering to superstitution? Does what really exists vary being by being i.e. sensory apparatus? What sort of being am I? What am I made of, made for?)
* Our modes of knowing: **epistemology**. Epistemological (systematic, organization and principle of facts) questions: are senses wrong? If so, what is right? Abstract rationality of Pythagoras? Customs? Religion? Epistemology is the study, criticism and refinements of our modes of knowing. Epistemic justification.

Is there heaven? Is there such a thing as goodness? Is there a moral reality and objectivity? Is there real beauty? Is there truth? Is there right or wrong?

The conclusion we reach is more or less based on the method we choose, often times blindly, by habit, social condition or conventional wisdom.
There tends to be a vicious circularity, between the claim (ontology) and the methods (epistemology).

Certainly the harmony and balance Greek perceived as beautiful, is not the same as what medieval artists found beautiful in their depiction of human form.
Yet the Greeks philosophers were unaware of the shifting.

**Democritus**: ultimate reality is but an incredibly large of atoms. Atoms and the space in between (the void).
Everything is ultimately reducible to that level. What we see as flowers, buildings, animals are but ephemeral, different in atomic composition.
The soul is a finer kind of atomics structure.

Earth, air, fire and water.

Can we even answer the ontological questions? Beautiful or ugly? True or false? Moral or not?

**Heraclitus**: "no one descends twice in the same river". Sees nothing but flux and change.

**Protagoras**: pre-Socratic. Founding father of **Sophist** thought.
"Man is the measure of all things."
Judgment of any form, must have some grounding, and that grounding can only be the experiences of a lifetime, we cannot take an epistemological position external to our own human ways of thought and feeling.
If there is a standard independent of human nature, we cannot even comprehend it.

Hence, is pursuing truth a misguided objective? Each person is the measure of all things. Truth is subjective. We are not equipped to comprehend it, even if there might be objective.

About the gods, I cannot say if they are or how they are constituted in shape, the unclarity of the subject and the shortness of human lives.
I can write you about what I see and hear and touch, but I cannot write you about the gods.

**Socrates** spends much of his work disputing the Sophists: much can be questioned about the claim.
Each man not only is not the measure of all things, we are generally very poor in understanding ourselves.
With him philosophy becomes a humanizing and humanistic enterprise (the human condition), from which there is no retreat.

### Greek tragedian on men's fate

Dance is important in Homer, Ovid and other classical authors. Dance of cranes Theseus.

Chorus + Dance + Participants and preliterate history and moral thought.

Out of possibility of drama comes the dispute and dialogue.
Philosophy may have come from cultural activities such as drama.
The thought refining itself.

The human condition as understood by the dramatists.
Is Medea a murderess, or are her motives irresistable? (Her sorcery practices are of Chthonic and pre-Olympian. When we surrender reason to passion, chaos ensues.)
What about the trial of Orestes?
The debate on Nomos (norm, natural law). Antigone. Is the law of kings higher, or the nature that sisters should bury brothers?

Euripides heroic characters are very much human.
At the end of day, character is destiny.

Aristotle's view on women, vs that of Greek tragedians.
Aristotle's view on tragedy: bad things happening to good people.

If there's an all seeing and all loving god, why such evil and injustice around us?

### Herodotus and history

Herodotus's Histories attributes war to irreconcilable differences in value.
Legions are moved with words and symbols.

Histories describes various people's dress, weapon, food, economonies and religious belief, to give a full perspective on events of historical significance, as opposed to mythology where such accounts on humanistic details are often glossed over.

Herodotus would suggest to account for events of historical significance, perspectives on sociology, pyschology beyond mere chronology is required.
And his teaching, or that of history, would be meaningful beyond ethnicity, and calls onto the roots of humanity itself.

Histories has clear distinctions for Herodotus's own opinions, opinions he has heard and facts.

His work, however, has many inaccurate accounts to establish some morals on the question of conduct. E.g. the emblematic meeting between Croesus and Solon, where the happiest men are established to be Kleobis and Biton, two sons who yoked themselves to their mother's cart, such that their mother, a priestess, would not be late for the festival of Hera.
They died peacefully after the deed.
Solon would claim only after one's story is complete can one be judged whether their lives being happy or not, and human happiness is not dependent on wealth.

### Socrates on the examined life

Teaching of Socrates is preserved by Zenophon and Plato (broad shoulders), who claims to be the mere scribe but his works are much more a portrayal of his and Socrates's thoughts via Socrates's mouth, than mere description.

Socrates lived in a time when Athens lost the Peloponnesian War against Sparta, and as a loyal faithful soldier of Athens, his thoughts are very often on the practical side, what went wrong with Athens, in matters of educating the youth, of conduct and government.
The Dialogues are conducted by the losing side, which often explains him taking a Spartan view on the matters above.

Socrates described himself as a gadfly asking those confident in their thoughts, reminding us of the gadfly sent by Zeus to unseat Bellerophon from Pegasus, an analogy for unseating the confident writers.

He was well trained by his Sophist teachers (sophistical teaching), known for their skills in debate and rhetorics and to expose the ignorance of the interlocuter via whimsical and deft conversations.

Yet Socrates aimed to defeat the skepticism and cynicism, claiming that there is something we can truly know, and knowing that our methodology of knowing is sound, contrasting his thoughts from those of Pythagoras.

St. Augustine would consider Socrates the only true philosopher, one committed to living and dying by his own philosophy, the inquiries he perceived as true, and the cause of reason, not like Pyrrho / Pyrrhonism (a school of skepticism).

Socrates was found guilty of failure to respect the Gods, despite him being a reverential person, and corrupting the youth. The Symposium, which has inquires on the nature of love, ended with Socrates returning home alone.

Neither charges were truthful, and Socrates had the choice of death or exile (ostracism of at least 10 yrs, on which Pericles was also charged), and choose the former (hemlock poisoning) in defense of his thoughts, and the rule of law (the public expression of rational thoughts, reason without passion).

A Homeric ending (think Hector "breaker of horses") where upon death, he uttered "will you remember to pay the debt".

Socrates would teach "the unexamined life is not worth living".
What is wrong with the unexamined?
Socrates would describe it as a screen on which events are laid out and not a lived life, as prisoners living in a cave watching parapets on which the shadows of puppets are cast, where all they see is shadows and illusion.

Examine, in the sense of interpretation of meaning of events, integration of experience, subject to the refinements through self criticism and introspection, and making the thought whole.

This connects back to the motto at the Oracle of Delphi "know thyself", meaning knowing what it means to be a human being? Beyond the biology, constituents, etc.
The Socratic agenda would argue against skepticism and cynicism, and realizing the interconnectedness between matters of knowledge, conducts and governance.
Dealing first with knowledge and establishing a good philosophical basis that there is something we can know, one kernel of truth we can know (if we can't know anything as the skepticists claim, then the life is uselessly examined, prejudices and self deceptions).
If it is possible to know something, know that you know it, and know the methodology of knowing it, then we can inquire into what kind of life is right for beings such as ourselves? Happiness and pleasure? Are they the same for all people, all cultures?
What about our values? Are they just relative, opinions and prejudices? What about governance, how should we be governed? Are the core precepts of Athenian democracy to be questioned?

Socrates would question Athenian democracy which Aristotle would later defend, claiming the collective wisdom is more likely to make good decisions as opposed to the strength of one, and the weaknesses are likely to cancel each other out.

### Plato and the search for Truth

To be able to arrive at any truth, one first defeats the skepticism claim that nothing can definitively be known.

Plato's Meno deals with the search for Truth, where Socrates converses with Meno, a noble from an area with strong Sophist presence, on whether virtue comes from teaching, or nature.

Socrates in Meno instructs by guiding the barbarian servant boy of Meno's to discovering the Pythagoras theorem.
And claims knowledge is a form of reminiscence, where, through philosophical guidance, one is no longer clouded by the sensory systems of the material world, and recalls the Truth that the soul had always known.

Hence Plato establishes that **Truth** is different from **facts**, where the former is eternal, not sensory, and cannot come by perceptions, and the latter is ephemeral, material, and as Heraclitus would claim, always in flux, as the material world would be.

Facts are various forms of rectilinear triangles drawn on the sand (flux, ephemeral, and material), and Truth is Pythagorean theorem that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is the true form of rectilinear triangle. (Aristotle would argue this is Platonic and not Socratic. Plato's work is also divided by later scholars into early, mid, and late where some ideas came earlier are later revised.)

How is Truth acquired? One has it intuitively. The gift of rationality.

Plato draws much from Pythagoras, in illustrating Truth with his discovery, and in transmigration of souls where he would claim with death, the soul is liberated.

Plato considers mathematical Truth an example of knowledge we know for certainty, and where the skepticists are wrong, but the debate would continue with evolution on both sides.

To Plato the problem then becomes identifying mathematics-like Truth, and it can be discovered by **the dialectical approach**, to achieve something abstract and uncover what one has always possessed but became clouded by the material world.

To this end, it is also thought that the discovery of Truth has naught to do with experience, and the experience of many do not necessarily draw us any closer to Truth, than the experience of one.
On this ground Socrates would question the basis of Athenian democracy.

### Can virtue be taught (Plato's Protagoras)

Problem of conduct, to each his own? Vicious, hedonistic?
Is there truth to ethics, morality? Is there moral objectivity?

The Socratic / Platonic school would combat the skepticists in the above domain, claiming the problem of conduct is not to be solved at the level of merely personal desire.
The same argumentative approach to knowledge should be applied.

How life should be lived? What kind of life is right for beings such as ourselves?

Plato's Protagoras.

Setting: Protagoras is in town, a young 30s Socrates put several questions to Hippocrates (not the physician) who woke him up to this news.

Socrates then raises the questions to Protagoras, who eloquently discourses on virtue, conduct, etc.
Socrates and Protagoras then engaged in Socratic dialectical method, and hard to say who had the upper hand.

What do you want to be, that makes you want to study under Protagoras?
Protagoras claims moral excellence.

What is virtue? (Justice, temperance, courage, wisdom, etc, what are they? Parts of virtue? Parts in what sense?)
Is virtue teachable?

Both men agree knowledge is the greatest, and there must be knowledge first, before there is virtue.
Knowledge known in some non-sensory way.

How do we teach anybody anything?
We teach by providing sensible, visible, ostensive objects.
Anything taught by showing, cannot be universal.
What do you point to, to say that is virtue, to teach virtue?

The teaching of technique, vs the teaching of Sophia?

You can't show the universal, but you can show an instance of it.
Perhaps we can teach virtue by pointing to persons practicing virtue.
Point Leonidas at Thermopylae to a one year old, and he wouldn't be able to comprehend.

Socrates argues to the conclusion virtue cannot be taught as such.
Perhaps the knowledge (wisdom), attained by philosophical reflection, is the grounding of virtue. This is teachable.
The one-year-olds aren't ready for it, many aren't ready for it in their entire lives.

The students must have been prepared (to be receptive of such lessons), then you may find such persons resonating to the virtuous act, when it presents itself.

What kind of preparation is necessary, for one to be considered ready for instructions by the virtuous?
This is discussed in The Republic.

Theaetetus is another piece where Protagoras is a central figure, and claims men is the measure of all things. I will do things that please me.
At the end of the day, the problem of conduct is a problem of principle, something universally right.

The Socratic approach to knowledge would claim each man is not the measure of all things.
There is a measure of all things, and it's the task of each man to understand that measure and apply it properly.

### Plato's Republic

Late-middle dialogue.

Russell on the Republic: fascist and imperialistic.

Foundational work in political science.
Tied to the considerations of statecraft are observations on moral, justice, weakness of human, hence somewhat foundational in psychology.

Sepheles, near death and ponders on wealth.
Polymarchus, what it means to be just is to pay one's debt.

Can an unjust person be happy and make great progress?

Thrasymachus: strong should prey on the weak.

Glaucon: what is goodness? Three classes
* Things that are good in and of themselves. Harmless pleasures.
* Things that are good in themselves but also for the consequences that arise from such good. Knowledge, health.
* Pursued for the same of their results. Gymnastics, money making.

Where is justice placed?
Socrates: the first, where things are pursued for their intrinsic value, not for consequences.

Glaucon, Adeimantus: Those seem just may not be just.
Virtue may arise purely from fear of punishment and desire of reward, not for the sake of being virtuous.

Example of Ring of Gyges (invisibility, used to commit unjust).

Being just may be for reputation, not for the sake of justice.

Socrates suggests to inspect the state instead, so that we can seek justice on an enlarged scale, rather than on each flimsy individuals.

No claim can be made towards politics, without understanding human nature.

Guardians. Elimination of greed, no payments. Shared partners. Marriage "lottery" in festivals but actually chosen breeders. Breed the guardians. Pure eugenics.

Problem of knowledge.
Allegory of the cave. Being shackled and faced with parapets with projections, shadowy illusions. Each man his own measure.
Imagine one breaks out, discovers the outside and realized what they've perceived as true are merely halluciatory experience.
This one goes back to share his experience, the others wouldn't be able to comprehend and instead thought him as blinded by the light.

Being bound by our material selves, resisting transcendance, believing whatever we see and only what we see.
Ignorance is darkness. See the reality behind the appearance of shadowy illusions. To appreciate / comprehend Leonidas at Thermopylae, one needs to be preconditioned.

The eyes and ears never record the truth, and what they do pick up will never be parlayed into the truth.
Being experientialist, while missing the point of life, not even understanding life has a point.

There are some things that only be seen under the light of philosophical examination / the wise man's guidance.

Problem of knowledge then gets us back to the search of truth, of the relationship as the relationships constitute the true form of things.

What is a good government is then answered in terms of relationship: between the ruled and the rulers, laws, where authority is vested and for what purpose.
Justice is also perceived as the the harmonious relationship among the rational, the passionate, the emotional dispositions of the soul.

Also behavioral theory e.g. children has to be protected from vulgar music but exposed to martial music.

How should we behave? How should we live our lives?
We are corporeal, inclined towards pleasure and avoid pains.
We are like charioteers standing on two horses, a good horse and a vicious one, a metaphor also found in India. 

A will capable of resolving us to follow the right course.
The will itself cannot decide what the right course is, desire knows only one course: to fulfill itself.
How then do we discover the right course: through rational power. Supremacy of reason in determining what we ought to do. Reason as shown in mathematical proportion, harmony, balance. The guide and goal of life. Avoid excess.

The Pythagorean numerological balance is the resemblance of truth.

### Hippocrates of Kos and Greek medicine

Contemporary of Socrates.

Plato -> Aristotle (whose father was a physician), movement in the direction of natural science

Secularize and analyze a subject that is generally related with religion and customs.

Greek medicine is close to modern practices in its being scientific, realizes diet, hereditary disposition as causes for conditions. (Health as related with the state of the body, as opposed to religion and customs.)

Few (or perhaps none) of the writings of Hippocratic school were by Hippocrates himself.

Pythagoras' sect of medical views: treat the body with vegetarianism, ritual performance (musical harmony) and exercises.

Hellenic civilization objectified itself (and the natural world), for the purpose of critical scrutiny.
Secularizing of knowledge, as opposed to realizations brought by prophets.

Hippocratic writers are religious, but they hold the religious account constant.
They provide a science that is liberated from religious orthodoxy.
Hippocratic medicine is not necessarily superior to Egyptian medicine, which dates even earlier, but it is based on an entirely different set of suppositions.

Once a society confers upon a selected group ultimate epistemological authority, on core questions arising from the problem of knowledge, the nearly inevitable result is philosophical paralysis: positions become quite hardened, and the only work left for scholars is to interpret the words of the wise.
The debate is no longer about knowledge and truth, but how a text or holy maxim is to be understood.

Empirical. Empiricist. The Greek word "observation".
Science is an empirical enterprise.

Hippocratic writers describe themselves as empirical, as their treatment is based off of clinical observation, naturalizing the natural world.

How is apoplexy understood?
Eastern Christianity, influenced by Greek thoughts, perceives it as a viral attack on the body (empirical).
Western Christianity, much more (theological) theory driven, perceives it as retribution for the victim's wickedness (divine, spiritual intervention).

Hippocratic writers correctly identified the brain as the central organ that processes sensory information, being correct whereas Aristotle was not (heart, while brain controls the temperature of the blood).

The celebrated figures of this age (Socrates, Hippocrates, Aristotle, etc), were a conspicuous minority.
This would be an uncommon group in any age. The mass of the people has a deep suspicion towards philosophers.
The perspective developed by these few was not widely shared.

There was a perfectionist idea wide spread in Hellenistic civilization. In rhetorics, tragedy, physical competitions, architecture, works of art, etc.
Similarly in mathematics and philosophy.

Hellenism bequeathed this pursuit to later societies.

### Aristotle on the knowable

Aristotle has so much original, hence so much criticism from those who came after.

His role in logic, biology, physics, natural science, political science and metaphysics are fundamental.

He spent 20yrs in Plato's Academy, where some small fraction of his teachings are present in Plato's dialogues.

Aristotle's **Metaphysics** proposed many thoughts different from Socratic and Platonic view.

It offered a presentation of pre-Socratic and Socratic schools of thoughts, serving as a good account of the history of philosophy and Hellenic thoughts in general.

Aristotle usually inspects the historical work done, what is left wanting, and goes from there.

##### On senses

Metaphysics opens with

_"All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses"_

This sets a fundamentally different tone from a Platonic dismissiveness towards senses.
**Nature produces nothing without a purpose**, and senses do not exist to deceive creatures.
Perception must be the starting point of knowledge.

##### On classification

Aristotle proposes different perceptual modes of knowledge.

What's the fundamental power (Greek word Dynamics) in which a living thing has life?
* Nutritive. A living creature has the means to absorb nutritions from its surroundings to sustain itself.
* Reproductive. A living species can reproduce.
* Locomotive. Some living creatures have the power to move. Some plants don't.
* Sensation. The ability to act knowingly / consciously. Animals possess this.
* Rationality. The (soul / psyche / power) of reason / a special rationality / cognitive power to allow beings to grasp universal propositions: all men must die, vs that men died. Our laws is another example of generality.

Aristotle's view on knowing also differs from Plato's.
As opposed to Plato's Meno in which he talks about facts and Truth with the latter being awakening something we inherently know via dialectical methods.

Aristotle claims there are two modes of knowing, e.g. the angles of a triangle sums up to 180
* By measurement. This is by experience and factual.
* By definition. This is episteme and appeals to generality.

##### On the cause

_"Happy is the man who knows the cause of things"_

What's the cause of a statue?
* On the **material level**, there's the stone. It couldn't have existed otherwise.
* A statue possesses certain features to differentiate it from just any stone. This is the cause on the **formal level**.
* Then there's the **efficient cause** of one blow after another by the sculptor, where each blow is the cause for the next.
* Finally how do you know where to hit the material? You have to know what you aim to achieve. Then the **ultimate / final cause** is that intelligent design.

Final in time, first in conception.

Unless you have an intelligent plan to begin with, otherwise nothing will come about.
(Greek telos. A teleological explanation, identifying the purposes, plans, designs and goals)

Teleological does not assume sentient beings.
Evolutionary theory is teleological, where wings, mating behavior, etc serve specific purposes.

We do not understand something fully unless we know **all four modalities**.
The number of things we know are based on the questions we ask:
* does it exist? 
* If it does, to what degree?
* In what relation does it stand to other things?
* What is it for? 

The central point of Aristotelian program are these four causes / questions, in domain of knowledge, politics, ethics, etc.

In politics, what is the polis for?

In ethics, what kind of being am I? How do the actions of my mine either realize what is potential within me, or stultify such potentials? What am I here for (my potentials?) How do I live my life to honor the central fact of my being?

Living things of the universe fit in a plan.
Nothing with pattern or design comes about accidentally.

_"If the art of shipbuilding were in the wood, ships would exist by nature."_

Ask the ultimate question: what is it for?
To know in this sense, is to comprehend far more than anything conveyed by the mere composition of the object.

What are atoms for?
Knowing all are made of atoms is pure materiality, and does not rise to the level of episteme.

Aristotle's explanation is usually universal (by and large, in general) and deterministic.
E.g. his view on scientific theory needs to be general, where the explained event is a particular instance.

### Aristotle on Friendship

Men are by nature social and political.

Bees and swans are social by nature, too.

The natural Aristotle question (what is it for) then becomes:
What's the point of us grouping ourselves together?
What purpose is served by the tendency towards complex (and larger scale) social and political lives?

Why go beyond small tribal communities? Why a polis?
Self-defense? Large communities are destroyed left and right.
Trade? Tribal communities, too, trade.

Discussed in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics.

Friendship is first inspected in the two works of Ethics.
* Friendship can be formed for pleasure, including sensual pleasure, which Aristotle is not against. These pleasure have an ephemeral feature about them.
* Friendship can be based on utility (utilitarian). A and B are useful for each other. These, too, are often ephemeral.
These friendships are self-regarding, selfishly motivated
* There is also friendship formed on Teleia-philia ("completed / perfected" friendship). Shared by the friends is a set of morals and values. What A wants for B and is good for B for the sake of B. A constructive relationship that is preserved and celebrated. Friendship conduced to goodness / moral excellence itself, and usually lasts a lifetime. Aristotle considers this kind of friendship to be not common.

The above is obtained by two who are equally worthy, few among the general populace.
Some would argue then the polis would be too small with those that meet this moral standard.

How unequal would the two parties need to be for such friendship to be impossible?
The inequality between humans and gods.

An example, an audience with good taste enjoying a performance. The audience does not have the training of the performers, but there is mutual respect and each understands what is best and good in the other, for the other in the other's sake.

Then you could form a polis without all people being morally equal.

What is virtue?
It's a disposition / inclination to act towards certain ends and avoid other ends.

Virtue is to be understood in two senses
* Intellectual excellence. Science, artistic, technical, central to a creative life. These are not innate, and come from learning, discipline and practice.
* Moral excellence. These are habitual forms of activity, and are reinforced by discplined practice as well. Receding Platonic's view of men of gold, silver and bronze, borrowed from Hesiod. (A program of research directed at the world as we know it.)

Is anger (first word in Illiad) good or bad?
Natured equipped us with such emotions, it'd be wrong to say such emotions are pathological.
The right question then becomes what should be one's disposition towards anger? What should one be angry for?

To become angry when virtue triumphs vice is bad.

The virtue is the middle ground of extreme excess and extreme defect.
Courage is the mid point between heedlessness and cowardice.
The middle route is the best (opposing excess, common in Greek thoughts).

Those who are fit to rule are those of virtue who are fit for friendship.

Aristotle claims in the order of things, the polis precedes families (the pattern of obligation parents have towards children and vice versa) and entities (identification of the individual, bound up with familial and political life).

The life of the hearthless, stateless, lawless men is the worst imaginable life.
A productive life involves familial and political duties and obligations.

Aristotle displays a suspiciousness towards radical democratic forms of rule.
His ideal model could be that a constitutional monarchy, where the rule of law is determinated, and those who determine the law function as friends.

### Aristotle on the perfect life

Discussed in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics.

Episteme, the intellectual virtues by which we are able to comprehend the cause of things.

The perfect life, one that guided by scientific, systematic knowledge.

We are artistic objects of self-defining, self-creating nature.
To get a work of art ever more complete.

Make the right kind of choices, based on good reasons.
Good reasons for acting, our actions not merely reactions.

Sound and defensible reasons for action is a form of wisdom and knowledge.
Prudential knowledge.
Philosophically wise -> Sophia 
Practically wise -> Phronesis, making good choices

The right life contemplates the best, what is worth thinking about.
By contemplating on the stock market, you may be lowering your thoughts to the transient, episodic and culturally defined.

Why should one aspire to moral excellence?
Why should one be courageous and temperate?

A regress of questions until it makes no sense to ask why that:
* Why see a doctor?
* Why you want to be in health?
* Why you want to hold on to your job?
* ...
* Ultimately everything we do we do for happiness - **eudaimonia**.

Not in a hedonistic sense.
What does Aristotle mean by eudaimonia?
Not peak emotional experience, or a transient state, but a mode of **flourishing life**, something unique for rational beings and beyond basic instincts.

What does eudaimonia entail?
It's an open question and the two Ethics offer different alternatives.

To lose eudaimonia is like ridding a being of its defining attribute: fish out of water, birds cannot fly, and man without his rationality / contemplating on the best of things.

What you do you do for the sheer fulfillment arising from doing it, is like the life on the isle of the blessed, that of the Olympians.
Like children at play.
One that approximates eudaimonia.

This contemplative life should not be a life of inactivity or isolation, as we are by nature social and political.

Fitness - harmonia <-> discordia
Music - melodia

Aristotle see the rule of law as the rule of reason, laws based on punishment are tyrannical laws.
Good laws calls upon us to do things that make us better, not stop us from doing things for fear of punishment; we see in the law something we see in good friends.

Are the life of the law giver and the disinterested contemplative wise man competing (activity and decisive action / contemplation and study)?
That's the dillema faced by all, who weigh the contemplation of choices between the first things and making the world conform to one's best judgments.
