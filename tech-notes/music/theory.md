### musical distance

```
... C    D    E F    G    A    B C (one octave) ...
```

Chromatic scale, equivalent in sharps and flats
```
... C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C (sharps)     ... 
... C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B C (flats)      ... 
```

### Scale

E.g. A (starting note) Major (pattern)

The major pattern goes as, whereas W means whole step, and H means half step
```
    W    W    H W    W    W    H
```
mapping onto the starting note of A, we have
```
A   B    C# D   E    F#   G#   A  (A major)
```

Another example

F Major
```
F   G    A A#   C    D    E    F  (F major)
F   G    A Bb   C    D    E    F
```

Minor
```
    W    H W    W    H W    W
```

A minor
```
    A    B C    D    E F    G
```

### Scale degrees

The note you start on is 1. The rest fall in line.

Harmonic minor: sharpen the 7.
```
    A    B C    D    E F    G    A  (A natural minor)
    A    B C    D    E F    G#   A  (A harmonic minor)
```
