# One man's view of the world

### China

Deeply rooted cultural belief in a strong center. 韬光养晦。

Possible yet hard problems:
* Lack of the rule of law. The man is above the office. 关系。
* Corruption. Anti-meritocracy.
(little incentive to change)
* state-owned companies and low efficiency (how do you privatise in a fair way? who do you sell it to?)
* development disparity between coastal and inland regions (development of cities need migration, but not too fast. The hukou system is flawed, but you cannot just get rid of it: local government cannot handle the cost, does not have enough renevue, or have the planning required.)
* intellectual property rights hindering innovation

"Your (the Chinese older) generation has been through the anti-Japanese war, the Civil War, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the Gang of Four, and now the Open Door policy. You know there are numerous pitfalls, and that for China to go up the escalator without mishap, you need stability internally, and peace externally. But you are inculcating enormous pride and patriotism in your young in a restored China."

"The reserves of manpower in the western provinces will carry China forward at a growth rate of about 7,8,9 per cent for 15,20 years. After that, increases will depend on productivity -- how they educate their people to produce more in the same number of hours."

"Finally, China needs to make the transition from an export-driven economy to one driven by domestic consumption, like the US economy...The income gap is one factor holding back domestic consumption."

Mentality of the middle and lower class also needs to change: from saving towards more spending.

Democracy: can you change the government by votes?

### The US

“China has the advantage of being in the region and will be able to project power much more easily (than the US) in Asia”

The power shift will happen, but will not happen quickly because of US advanced technology.

“Many Asian countries welcomed this reaffirmed commitment from the Americans. For years, America’s presence has been an important stabilizing factor for the region. Continued presence would help maintain that stability and security. China’s size means that, ultimately, only the US – in partnership with Japan and South Korea, and in cooperation with the Asean countries – can balance it.”

“the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must” -- Thucydides

“I, too, feel some sense of regret at this shifting power balance because I see the US as basically a benign power.”
They fight in Vietnam and Korea for an anti-communist cause, not for new territories.

“Singapore is quite comfortable with the Americans being present. We do not know how brash or assertive China will become. When I said in 2009 that we must balance China, they translated the word in Chinese into “conscribe”, and there was a big uproar among their netizens, who asked how dare I say that when I am a Chinese. They are hypersensitive. And even after I pointed out to them that I never said “conscribe”, they were not placated. It is a young, raw power coming to the fore.”

“Nearly five decades have elapsed and history has shown that the ability to speak English and to communicate with the world has turned out to be one of the most important factors in Singapore’s growth story.”

“America has prevailed. It will do so again.
The success of America lies in its dynamic economy, sustained by an uncanny ability not just to produce the same with the less, but to constantly innovate – that is, to invent completely new goods and services that the rest of the world soon finds to be useful and desirable.”

“America is, by far, the more creative society. And the fact that the Americans are having an internal debate about whether or not they are declining is a healthy sign. It means they have not become complacent.”

“Firstly, the US is a more attractive society than China can ever be. Every year, thousands of bright and restless immigrants are allowed into American, settle and become successful in various fields. These immigrants are innovative and usually more adventurous, or they would not have left their own countries.”

“China and other nations will eventually have to adopt parts of the American model of attracting talent to fit their circumstances. They will have to go looking around for talented people to build up their enterprises. That is the final contest.”

“Some Singaporeans are choosing to stay in the US after studying there. That is why I am in favour of sending students on scholarships to Britain instead, because I am sure they will come back. In the UK, you do not stay behind because you are not welcome. And because the economy is less dynamic, there are fewer jobs for you.”

“So in soft power, the Chinese will not win.”
The Chinese language.

“Another source of American competitiveness are the many competing centres of excellence throughout the country.”

“Because of this, there is a certain diversity in society, a competitive spirit that throws up new ideas and new products that survive the test of time.”

“The Chinese believe that when the centre is strong, China prospers. “Everyone is expected to march to the same drummer. ”

“Americans run a leaner, more competitive system. They file more patents. They are always striving to make something new or do something better. Of course, this has to come at a price. American unemployment fluctuates like a yoyo. An underclass has developed as a result."

“If you choose instead the welfare state, as Europe did after the Second World War, you naturally become less dynamic.”

“Finally, America has a culture that celebrates those who strike out on their own. When they succeed, they are admired as talented entrepreneurs and accorded the social status and recognition they rightly deserve. When they fail, it is accepted as a natural intermediate stage, necessary for eventual success, so they pick themselves up and start afresh.”

“Everybody celebrated getting rich – and wanted to get rich. There is a great urge to start new enterprises and create wealth. Even within American companies, the young tend to have a bigger say at meetings, and the tremendous effervescence they have is channelled to help the companies become more inventive.”

##### The problems

"the US enjoys much lower borrowing costs than other countries because it's the world's reserve currency. “But there is little room for complacency because spending is going in the wrong direction. Social Security and Medicare costs will become unbearable within 30 years if nothing is done to reform the current regime."

“America was in denial mode, with Congress and the president unable to come to consensus about the need for prompt and bitter medicine. Each side had their eyes on the next election, instead of the long-term outcome for America.”

“America does, however, have other grave problems of long-term consequence that may not be attracting the political debate they deserve. One of their biggest challenges is education”

“Having elite universities is well and good, but you cannot be concurrently churning out illiterate or near-illiterate students from your elementary and high schools. It is this group that America might be failing through a neglect of basic and technical education.”

Public school funding and this being a state matter is a big hindrance.

“Other problems that plague the US: the need for a nationwide infrastructural upgrade, a growing class divide, persistent discrimination according to race, and an electoral process that is too dependent on money and which is so gruelling that it puts off good men and women who may otherwise consider serving the nation.”

“just as Americans tend to exaggerate their own virtues, they sometimes exaggerate their problems too. It makes for good television. Newspapers use it to attract more readers. It is also a carefully honed skill in political debate, as you attack the other side by blowing certain faults out of proportion. Uninitiated foreign observers may find this unsettling at first, but soon enough, they learn to separate rhetoric from reality.”

“Rhetoric aside, Americans fundamentally believe that tomorrow will be a sunny day. That explains their propensity to spend, borrow, and spend some more. The Chinese and the Japanese, on the other hand, always believe there may be an earthquake or some other disaster around the corner, so they feel the need to put something by.”

“I admire the optimism in American society: their can-do approach to life, their belief that every problem can be solved if resources are brought to bear on it and that everything can be broken up, analysed and redefined.”

“But the Japanese and Koreans will want to keep their security relationships with America, even if they are economically tied to China. The US-China relationship will be the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century.”

“Unwisely, they went into Afghanistan after September 11 and tried to build a nation, ignoring the fact that it had not been a nation for the last 30 to 40 years.”

“President George W. Bush went into Iraq with the best of intentions. Saddam Hussein was an irrational dictator whose actions destabilised the region and the world. A strong case could be made for taking him down. But when the Americans announced their aspiration to democratise Iraq, I held my breath. It was a sign of hubris. I thought to myself: “This is a 4,000-year-old society that is going to be transformed by a society that has only got – if you go back to the Mayflower – 400 years of history.”

“They removed Saddam, a strong man who held the disparate forces of the country together and made it governable, without producing or supporting another strong man who could fill Saddam’s shoes, which is what they should have done. ”

“The Americans wanted to build a government from scratch in Iraq and democratise an ancient people. The former is near impossible, the latter is simply impossible.”

“In this regard, the Chinese have the wiser foreign policy approach. They do not believe it is their business to change the system. They deal with a system as it is and get whatever advantages they can out of it, without entangling themselves. The problem with the Americans is that they go in believing they have the power to change the system. Time and again, they have been proven wrong.”

“They have not changed the world. They may be able to change Fiji or Vanuatu, where the civilisations are young and not deep-rooted, and you can overwhelm them with, say, Christianity. But can they change China or India? These are nations with ancient traditions of their own.”

### Europe

“The fundamental problem with the euro is that you cannot have monetary integration without fiscal integration – especially in a region with spending and thrift habits as diverse as those of Germany and Greece.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“These include expanding the supply of money - what the Americans call “quantitative easing” - and devaluing the currency to make the country’s exports more attractive. But these were tools that the eurozone countries gave up as a result of their entry into a common monetary community. They did so, furthermore, without ensuring that there would be budgetary transfers similar in type and magnitude to those that depressed states in the United States receive.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“There is a third outcome that falls between a complete break-up and full integration. It is a partial break-up.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books.

“Even as Europe attempts to sort out the problems associated with the single currency, the continent cannot afford to take its eyes off other underlying causes of its relative lack of dynamism - the welfare state and rigid labour market laws.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“If Europe is to avoid sustained lethargy and regain the energy and industriousness it was once known for, it has to make bold and painful reforms to reduce its elaborate system of entitlements and to liberalise hiring and firing rules for companies.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“As the world became more globalised, the lower-skilled European workers found themselves competing not just among themselves but with workers from Japan, and later from China and India as well. Exports were undercut and industries gradually moved their production centres to Asia. Naturally, the wages of European workers also declined.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“You may want to move up the scale but significant segments of the population may not be able to move because it would involve learning new skills, which takes time, energy and, above all, will.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“Laws and policies, unfortunately, do not change as easily as global circumstances do. Entitlements, once given, are notoriously difficult to take back. There is a tremendous penalty in votes for any government that has the guts to try”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“The most pernicious effect of the welfare state, however, lies not in its inflexibility or its unaffordable nature but in the negative effect it has on the individual’s motivation to strive.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“But how do you change these policies now? You have unions marching through the streets of Paris, who will not buy the argument that global competitive forces have rendered the French workforce uneconomic, and that they have to give up their frills. They would say: “No, we keep these frills and try and compete.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“Bitter years await Europe. The Europeans have chosen to go down the path of welfare and labour protection due to the unique historical circumstances they were in. Nobody can deny that their choices have resulted in kinder societies, with less of an underclass and a smaller gap between winners and losers when compared to America.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“one should acknowledge that the Scandinavian countries have indeed performed significantly better than their European neighbours in terms of growth.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“Norway, at 5 million, has fewer people than Singapore does. The scale of problems, the diversity of interests and the complexity of governance are therefore vastly different in Scandinavia.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“More important than size, however, is composition – the key to understanding Scandinavian exceptionalism. Sweden, Norway and Denmark have relatively homogeneous populations, giving these nations an internal cohesion not possible in other parts of Europe. Their people have a much stronger sense of oneness and togetherness. Each of the three countries thinks of itself as one tribe, with members of the tribe prepared to suffer for one another.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“Over the years, because of declining birth rates and the need for labour, European countries have taken in migrants from Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. Immigration has alleviated economic and demographic pressures but has also given rise to a different set of problems.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“The people of Europe are not as open to immigration as the people of America. They have not succeeded in integrating immigrants already residing permanently among them.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“In the last two to three, Europeans leaders – including David Cameron, Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel – have separately declared that multiculturalism has failed in their countries. In other words, the Turks who have settled in Germany have not become Germans, nor have the Algerians Tunisians in France become French.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“But it is also not possible for Europe to stop the inflow because these immigrants meet a pressing domestic need. So we may well see European governments letting in immigrants when they can, only to hit the brakes when electoral cycles come around and far right parties outflank their moderate opponents with angry rhetoric.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“Alas, all the signs point to the impossibility of integration. They have so far failed to make a single currency work and are not likely to progress to a single foreign policy stance or a single military. They have individual histories, each going back many centuries. Each nation is proud of its own traditions. Above all, they want to keep their languages alive – there is glory and literature behind it. America decided to start afresh and create a new literature, but Europe will not be able to do so.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“Europe’s declining international voice, however, will not result in its living standards failing by the same magnitude. If it can survive the break-up of the euro, it goes back to what it was. Europe loses its voice in the world, but the countries in it have a high standard of education and skills and can make a good living. There will be some decline, but each country will reach a steady state at its own level of competitiveness. The Europeans will lead lives that are happy enough.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

“The population is declining, the economy is dependent on gas and oil and there is no real social economy. Pessimism reigns as seen in the high level of alcohol consumption and the fact that the women are not bearing enough children.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books. 

### Japan

“The most serious challenge facing Japan is demographic. Its population is rapidly ageing and not replacing itself. All its other problems - a stagnating economy and weak political leadership - pale in comparison. If Japan does not solve its demographic problem, its future will be very grim.”

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. “One man's view of the world.” Apple Books.
