# Money and prices in the long run

Wealth

Money
* Medium of transaction
* Unit of account
* Store of value

Kinds of money
* Intrinsic money (gold, cigarettes in prison camps)
* Fiat money (paper money)

* currency, checking account, saving account, money mutual funds


Fed
* serves as a lender of last resort to maintain financial stability in the system.
* controls money supply.

Reserve ratio: the fraction of total deposits that a bank holds as reserves.
The Fed sets a minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold, called a reserve requirement.
* if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply of money.
* when banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, the banking system creates money (it does not create any wealth).

Money multiplier (how much money does each dollar of reserve generates) is the inverse of reserve ratio. (E.g. if total deposit is 100, reserve ratio is 50%, then first bank can loan out 50 to second bank, creating 50 in money, second bank can loan out half to that to third, creating 25 in money, and the total amount of money in circulation is 200.)

A bank's balance sheet might look like
* Asset: reserves, loans made, and securities bought.
* Liability: deposits, debts, and capital (owner's equity)
The two are balanced by definition, because owner's equity is whatever the imbalance ends up being.
When capital goes negative, the bank becomes insolvent: it's unable to pay its debts.

The leverage ratio of a bank is its total asset to bank capital. (Capital comes from owners, everything else in liability is loaned, so total liability / capital is its leverage ratio.)

Bank regulators require banks to hold a certain amount of capital. The goal of such a capital requirement is to ensure that banks will be able to pay off their depositors (without having to resort to government-provided deposit insurance funds)


* Fed's control of money supply
  * influences the quantity of reserves
    * Open-market operation: the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds.
      * If the FOMC decides to increase the money supply, the Fed creates dollars and uses them to buy government bonds from the public in the nation's bond markets.
      * Conversely, if the FOMC decides to decrease the money supply, the Fed sells government bonds from its portfolio to the public in the nation’s bond markets. After the sale, the dollars the Fed receives for the bonds are out of the hands of the public.
    * Lending to banks
      * Fed lends to banks at a rate called discount rate: increasing it discourages banks from borrowing from the Fed, which brings down their reserves and reduces money supply.
  * influence reserve ratio
    * Change reserve requirement. Rare because it is disruptive and many banks hold excess reserves.
    * Paying interest on reserves. Since 2008, Fed started paying interest to banks reserve with the Fed. Increasing this rate incentivizes banks to increase reserve ratio.

The Fed's various tools are not precise: it needs some estimate of household deposits, and some estimate of banks' real reserve ratio.

* Fed funds rate: short term interest rate banks can charge one another for loans. (one bank with excess reserves lends to another short on reserves. Typically overnight, and priced at fed funds rate).
  * In practice this rate moves closely with discount rate.
  * Interest rates on different kinds of loans are strongly correlated with one another, and other interest rates often move in the same direction as this rate.
  * FOMC meeting sets a target fed fund rate, and let supply/demand hit the Fed fund rates it targetted. Supply/demand is controlled by Fed operation. E.g. when it buys national debt, fewer banks need to borrow to meet reserve requirement, and Fed fund rate drops.
  * When the Fed announces a change in the federal funds rate, it is committing itself to the open-market operations necessary to make that change happen, and these open-market operations will alter the supply of money.


### The demand for money

Reflects how much wealth people want to hold in liquid form.

The quantity of money demanded depends on the interest rate that a person could earn by using the money to buy an interest bearing bond rather than leaving it in his wallet or low-interest checking account.

A higher price level (a lower value of money) increases the quantity of money demanded.

**quantity theory of money** asserts that the quantity of money available determines
the price level and that the growth rate in the quantity of money available determines the inflation rate.

### Classical dichotomy

* nominal variables — variables measured in monetary units.
* real variables — variables measured in physical units.
* monetary neutrality - the proposition that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables

Monetary neutrality is unrealistic, especially in the short run -- the change in metric leads to confusions and mistakes, but less so in the long run.

### velocity of money

the rate at which money changes hands

quantity equation:

```
MoneySuppy * VelocityOfMoney = PriceOfOutput * AmountOfOutput
```
So when `MoneySupply` goes up, `Velocity` must go down or rhs must go up.

`Velocity` had been relatively stable throughout time.

If inflation is so easy to explain, why do the central banks of these countries choose to print so much money that its value is certain to fall rapidly over time?

The governments of these countries are using money creation as a way to pay for their spending.
Usually government spending is paid for by levying taxes, but it could also be paid for by printing money, somewhat like an **inflation tax**, like a tax on everyone who holds money.

When the government has high spending, inadequate tax revenue, and limited ability to borrow, it turns to the printing press to pay for its spending. The inflation ends when the government institutes fiscal reforms -- such as cuts in government spending -- that eliminate the need for the inflation tax.

### The Fisher effect
```
Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate
```
* the supply and demand for loanable funds determine the real interest rate.
* growth in the money supply determines the inflation rate.

Money neutrality in the long run suggests real interest rate is not affected by money supply, so when the Fed increases the rate of money growth, the long-run result is both a higher inflation rate and a higher nominal interest rate.

This adjustment of nominal interest rate to (expected) inflation rate is called the **Fisher effect**.

### Is inflation bad

Does it reduce people's purchasing power?
You pay more for what you buy, but most people as sellers of labor / services, also receive more for what they sell -- inflation does not in itself reduce people's real purchasing power.

But, persistent growth in money supply does have some adverse effects on real variables.
* inflation tax gives people an incentive to avoid paying this tax. (shoeleather cost: inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings)
* Menu costs (change of value of money -- decide the new price -- print the new menu -- cost)
* Misallocation of resources -- when inflation distorts relative prices, consumer decisions are distorted and markets are less able to allocate resources to their best use.
* Almost all taxes distort incentives, cause people to alter their behavior, and lead to a less efficient allocation of the economy's resources. Many taxes become even more problematic in the presence of inflation. (inflation tends to raise the tax burden on income earned from savings, e.g. inflation exaggerates the size of capital gains and inadvertently increases the tax burden on this type of income; or interest tax tax'ed on nominal interest rate).
  * Higher inflation tends to discourage people from saving (_that is, even after nominal interest rate catches up to inflation rate_).
  * In an ideal world, the tax laws would be written so that inflation would not alter anyone's real tax liability.
* Confusion and inconvenience.

Also, unexpected changes in prices redistribute wealth among debtors and creditors.
If inflation were predictable, then debtors and creditors could take inflation into account when setting the nominal interest rate (Fisher effect), but if inflation is hard to predict, it imposes risk on debtors and creditors that both would prefer to avoid.

There are no known examples of economies with high, stable inflation.
If a country pursues a high-inflation monetary policy, it will have to bear not only the costs of high expected inflation but also the arbitrary redistributions of wealth associated with unexpected inflation.

Deflation may be worse (e.g. when it comes as a surprise, it often results in the redistribution of wealth toward creditors and away from debtors. Because debtors are often poorer, these redistributions in wealth are particularly painful).
Also, deflation is often a symptom of deeper economic problems.

# Open economy, international trade

```
Net exports = Value of country's exports - Value of country's imports
Net capital outflow = Purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents - Purchase of domestic assets by foreigners.
```
When net capital outflow is postive, capital is flowing out of the country (e.g. residents buying foreign stocks, restaurant chain opening oversees branches)

```
Net exports = Net capital outflow
```
(when a domestic resident exports, they get paid in foreign currency -- acquiring foreign assets.)

When a nation is running a trade surplus, the foreign currency it acquires is used to buy foreign assets (capital is flowing out of the nation)

Components of a country's GDP (total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services)
```
GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Purchases + Net Exports
National Saving = Domestic Investment + Net Capital Outflow
```
(for each dollar of saving, it's either invested in domestic or foreign assets)

**Is trade deficit a national problem?**

Imagine trade deficit induced by a drop in national saving (e.g. US in the 1980s, when Reagan cut taxes, increased spending and enlarged government deficit), then it's better to have trade deficit / foreign investment, then having to drop domestic investment.

Now imagine trade deficit induced by investment boom like in the 90s, the economy is borrowing from abroad to fund its growth. The additional capital helps if the investment projects yielded good results.

Just as an individual can go into debt in either a prudent or a profligate manner, so can a nation. A trade deficit is not a problem in itself, but it can sometimes be a symptom of a problem

### Prices for international transactions

* **nominal exchange rate**: the rate at which a person can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another.
* **real exchange rate**: the rate at which a person can trade the goods and services of one country for the goods and services of another.
```
Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate * Domestic Price / Foreign Price
```
(Domestic Price, or Domestic Consumer Price Index)

Real exchange rate is a key determinant in how much a country exports / imports.

### Exchange rate determination

One theory of exchange rates, **purchasing-power parity**: a unit of any given currency should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all countries.

Parity means equality, and purchasing power refers to the value of money in terms of the quantity of goods it can buy. Purchasing-power parity states that a unit of a currency must have the same real value in every country. ($1 in the US and Japan gets the same amount of coffee.)

The assumption is no arbitrage. If there is disparity, arbitrage would happen to drag it back to parity.

```
Nominal Exchange Rate = Foreign Price Level / Domestic Price Level
```

Alternatively, Nominal Exchange Rate is a measure of relative inflation between countries.

Purchasing power parity is limited in that, many goods are not easily traded, and even tradable goods are not perfect substitutions when purchased in different countries.
