# One man's view of the world

### China

"The Chinese believe that when the centre is strong, China prospers. Everyone is expected to march to the same drummer."

Upcoming yet hard problems:
* Lack of the rule of law. The man is above the office. 关系。
* Corruption. Anti-meritocracy.
(for both there is little incentive to change)

* state-owned companies and low efficiency (how do you privatise in a fair way? who do you sell it to?)
* development disparity between coastal and inland regions (development of cities need migration, but not too fast. The hukou system is flawed, but you cannot just get rid of it: local government cannot handle the cost, does not have enough renevue, or the planning required.)
* intellectual property rights hindering innovation

"Your (the Chinese older) generation has been through the anti-Japanese war, the Civil War, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the Gang of Four, and now the Open Door policy. You know there are numerous pitfalls, and that for China to go up the escalator without mishap, you need stability internally, and peace externally. But you are inculcating enormous pride and patriotism in your young in a restored China."

"The reserves of manpower in the western provinces will carry China forward at a growth rate of about 7,8,9 per cent for 15,20 years. After that, increases will depend on productivity -- how they educate their people to produce more in the same number of hours."

"Finally, China needs to make the transition from an export-driven economy to one driven by domestic consumption, like the US economy...The income gap is one factor holding back domestic consumption."

Mentality of the middle and lower class also needs to change: from saving towards more spending.

Is China a Democracy: not in the sense that you can change the government by votes.

### The US

"China has the advantage of being in the region and will be able to project power much more easily (than the US) in Asia"

The power shift will happen, but will not happen quickly because of US advanced technology.

"For years, America's presence has been an important stabilizing factor for Asia. Continued presence would help maintain that stability and security. China's size means that, ultimately, only the US – in partnership with Japan and South Korea, and in cooperation with the Asean countries – can balance it."

"The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must" -- Thucydides

"I, too, feel some sense of regret at this shifting power balance because I see the US as basically a benign power."
They fight in Vietnam and Korea for an anti-communist cause, not for new territories.

"Singapore is quite comfortable with the Americans being present. We do not know how brash or assertive China will become. When I said in 2009 that we must balance China, they translated the word in Chinese into "conscribe", and there was a big uproar among their netizens, who asked how dare I say that when I am a Chinese. They are hypersensitive. And even after I pointed out to them that I never said "conscribe", they were not placated. It is a young, raw power coming to the fore."

"Nearly five decades have elapsed and history has shown that the ability to speak English and to communicate with the world has turned out to be one of the most important factors in Singapore's growth story."

"America has prevailed (in WWI, WWII, post-war competition with USSR, Germany, Japan). It will do so again.
The success of America lies in its dynamic economy, sustained by an uncanny ability not just to produce the same with the less, but to constantly innovate – that is, to invent completely new goods and services that the rest of the world soon finds to be useful and desirable."

"America is, by far, the more creative society (compared to China). And the fact that the Americans are having an internal debate about whether or not they are declining is a healthy sign. It means they have not become complacent."

"Firstly, the US is a more attractive society than China can ever be. Every year, thousands of bright and restless immigrants are allowed into American, settle and become successful in various fields. These immigrants are innovative and usually more adventurous, or they would not have left their own countries."

"China and other nations will eventually have to adopt parts of the American model of attracting talent to fit their circumstances. They will have to go looking around for talented people to build up their enterprises. That is the final contest."

"Some Singaporeans are choosing to stay in the US after studying there. That is why I am in favour of sending students on scholarships to Britain instead, because I am sure they will come back. In the UK, you do not stay behind because you are not welcome. And because the economy is less dynamic, there are fewer jobs for you."

"So in soft power (not speaking Engilsh as a native tongue), the Chinese will not win."

"Another source of American competitiveness are the many competing centres of excellence throughout the country. Because of this, there is a certain diversity in society, a competitive spirit that throws up new ideas and new products that survive the test of time."

"Americans run a leaner, more competitive system. They file more patents. They are always striving to make something new or do something better. Of course, this has to come at a price. American unemployment fluctuates like a yoyo. An underclass has developed as a result."

"If you choose instead the welfare state, as Europe did after the Second World War, you naturally become less dynamic."

"Finally, America has a culture that celebrates those who strike out on their own. When they succeed, they are admired as talented entrepreneurs and accorded the social status and recognition they rightly deserve. When they fail, it is accepted as a natural intermediate stage, necessary for eventual success, so they pick themselves up and start afresh."

"Everybody celebrated getting rich – and wanted to get rich. There is a great urge to start new enterprises and create wealth. Even within American companies, the young tend to have a bigger say at meetings, and the tremendous effervescence they have is channelled to help the companies become more inventive."

##### The problems

"the US enjoys much lower borrowing costs than other countries because it's the world's reserve currency. "But there is little room for complacency because spending is going in the wrong direction. Social Security and Medicare costs will become unbearable within 30 years if nothing is done to reform the current regime."

"America was in denial mode, with Congress and the president unable to come to consensus about the need for prompt and bitter medicine. Each side had their eyes on the next election, instead of the long-term outcome for America."

"America does, however, have other grave problems of long-term consequence that may not be attracting the political debate they deserve. One of their biggest challenges is education"

"Having elite universities is well and good, but you cannot be concurrently churning out illiterate or near-illiterate students from your elementary and high schools. It is this group that America might be failing through a neglect of basic and technical education."

Public school funding and this being a state matter is a big hindrance.

"Other problems that plague the US: the need for a nationwide infrastructural upgrade, a growing class divide, persistent discrimination according to race, and an electoral process that is too dependent on money and which is so gruelling that it puts off good men and women who may otherwise consider serving the nation."

"just as Americans tend to exaggerate their own virtues, they sometimes exaggerate their problems too. It makes for good television. Newspapers use it to attract more readers. It is also a carefully honed skill in political debate, as you attack the other side by blowing certain faults out of proportion. Uninitiated foreign observers may find this unsettling at first, but soon enough, they learn to separate rhetoric from reality."

"Rhetoric aside, Americans fundamentally believe that tomorrow will be a sunny day. That explains their propensity to spend, borrow, and spend some more. The Chinese and the Japanese, on the other hand, always believe there may be an earthquake or some other disaster around the corner, so they feel the need to put something by."

"I admire the optimism in American society: their can-do approach to life, their belief that every problem can be solved if resources are brought to bear on it and that everything can be broken up, analysed and redefined."

"But the Japanese and Koreans will want to keep their security relationships with America, even if they are economically tied to China. The US-China relationship will be the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century."

"Unwisely, they went into Afghanistan after September 11 and tried to build a nation, ignoring the fact that it had not been a nation for the last 30 to 40 years."

"President George W. Bush went into Iraq with the best of intentions. Saddam Hussein was an irrational dictator whose actions destabilised the region and the world. A strong case could be made for taking him down. But when the Americans announced their aspiration to democratise Iraq, I held my breath. It was a sign of hubris. I thought to myself: "This is a 4,000-year-old society that is going to be transformed by a society that has only got – if you go back to the Mayflower – 400 years of history."

"They removed Saddam, a strong man who held the disparate forces of the country together and made it governable, without producing or supporting another strong man who could fill Saddam's shoes, which is what they should have done. "

"The Americans wanted to build a government from scratch in Iraq and democratise an ancient people. The former is near impossible, the latter is simply impossible."

"In this regard, the Chinese have the wiser foreign policy approach. They do not believe it is their business to change the system. They deal with a system as it is and get whatever advantages they can out of it, without entangling themselves. The problem with the Americans is that they go in believing they have the power to change the system. Time and again, they have been proven wrong."

"They have not changed the world. They may be able to change Fiji or Vanuatu, where the civilisations are young and not deep-rooted, and you can overwhelm them with, say, Christianity. But can they change China or India? These are nations with ancient traditions of their own."

### Europe

"The fundamental problem with the euro is that you cannot have monetary integration without fiscal integration – especially in a region with spending and thrift habits as diverse as those of Germany and Greece."

"These include expanding the supply of money - what the Americans call "quantitative easing" - and devaluing the currency to make the country's exports more attractive. But these were tools that the eurozone countries gave up as a result of their entry into a common monetary community. They did so, furthermore, without ensuring that there would be budgetary transfers similar in type and magnitude to those that depressed states in the United States receive."

"There is a third outcome that falls between a complete break-up and full integration. It is a partial break-up."

Excerpt From: Lee Kuan Yew. "One man's view of the world." Apple Books.

"Even as Europe attempts to sort out the problems associated with the single currency, the continent cannot afford to take its eyes off other underlying causes of its relative lack of dynamism - the welfare state and rigid labour market laws."

"If Europe is to avoid sustained lethargy and regain the energy and industriousness it was once known for, it has to make bold and painful reforms to reduce its elaborate system of entitlements and to liberalise hiring and firing rules for companies."

"As the world became more globalised, the lower-skilled European workers found themselves competing not just among themselves but with workers from Japan, and later from China and India as well. Exports were undercut and industries gradually moved their production centres to Asia. Naturally, the wages of European workers also declined."

"You may want to move up the scale but significant segments of the population may not be able to move because it would involve learning new skills, which takes time, energy and, above all, will."

"Laws and policies, unfortunately, do not change as easily as global circumstances do. Entitlements, once given, are notoriously difficult to take back. There is a tremendous penalty in votes for any government that has the guts to try"

"The most pernicious effect of the welfare state, however, lies not in its inflexibility or its unaffordable nature but in the negative effect it has on the individual's motivation to strive."

"But how do you change these policies now? You have unions marching through the streets of Paris, who will not buy the argument that global competitive forces have rendered the French workforce uneconomic, and that they have to give up their frills. They would say: "No, we keep these frills and try and compete."

"Bitter years await Europe. The Europeans have chosen to go down the path of welfare and labour protection due to the unique historical circumstances they were in. Nobody can deny that their choices have resulted in kinder societies, with less of an underclass and a smaller gap between winners and losers when compared to America."

"one should acknowledge that the Scandinavian countries have indeed performed significantly better than their European neighbours in terms of growth."

"Norway, at 5 million, has fewer people than Singapore does. The scale of problems, the diversity of interests and the complexity of governance are therefore vastly different in Scandinavia."

"More important than size, however, is composition – the key to understanding Scandinavian exceptionalism. Sweden, Norway and Denmark have relatively homogeneous populations, giving these nations an internal cohesion not possible in other parts of Europe. Their people have a much stronger sense of oneness and togetherness. Each of the three countries thinks of itself as one tribe, with members of the tribe prepared to suffer for one another."

"Over the years, because of declining birth rates and the need for labour, European countries have taken in migrants from Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. Immigration has alleviated economic and demographic pressures but has also given rise to a different set of problems."

"The people of Europe are not as open to immigration as the people of America. They have not succeeded in integrating immigrants already residing permanently among them."

"In the last two to three, Europeans leaders – including David Cameron, Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel – have separately declared that multiculturalism has failed in their countries. In other words, the Turks who have settled in Germany have not become Germans, nor have the Algerians Tunisians in France become French."

"But it is also not possible for Europe to stop the inflow because these immigrants meet a pressing domestic need. So we may well see European governments letting in immigrants when they can, only to hit the brakes when electoral cycles come around and far right parties outflank their moderate opponents with angry rhetoric."

"Alas, all the signs point to the impossibility of integration. They have so far failed to make a single currency work and are not likely to progress to a single foreign policy stance or a single military. They have individual histories, each going back many centuries. Each nation is proud of its own traditions. Above all, they want to keep their languages alive – there is glory and literature behind it. America decided to start afresh and create a new literature, but Europe will not be able to do so."

"Europe's declining international voice, however, will not result in its living standards failing by the same magnitude. If it can survive the break-up of the euro, it goes back to what it was. Europe loses its voice in the world, but the countries in it have a high standard of education and skills and can make a good living. There will be some decline, but each country will reach a steady state at its own level of competitiveness. The Europeans will lead lives that are happy enough."

"The population is declining, the economy is dependent on gas and oil and there is no real social economy. Pessimism reigns as seen in the high level of alcohol consumption and the fact that the women are not bearing enough children."

### Japan

"The most serious challenge facing Japan is demographic. Its population is rapidly ageing and not replacing itself. All its other problems - a stagnating economy and weak political leadership - pale in comparison. If Japan does not solve its demographic problem, its future will be very grim."


### Singapore

"The biggest problem with the two-party system is that once it is in place, the best people will choose not to be in politics"

"In Britain, if you look at the First Class Honours list of Oxford or Cambridge and trace their careers, you will find that these people end up not in politics, but in banking, finance and the professions."

"But the difference between Singapore and those countries – that is, America and Britain – is that they will continue to do well despite an average government, but we will not. This is a small country with no natural resource and in the middle of a region that has been volatile historically. Special leadership is required here."

"It is true that no country in the world pays ministers as we do. But it is also true that no other island has developed like Singapore: sparkling, clean, safe, with no corruption and low crime rates. "

"With every pay reduction, the sacrifice that a minister makes – giving up his profession or his banking job – becomes greater. Some will eventually tell themselves: "I don't mind doing this for half a term, two and a half years, as a form of national service. But beyond that, it has to be: thanks but no thanks." The final outcome would be a revolving door government, which will inevitably lack a deep understanding of the issues or the incentive to think about problems in a long-term manner."

"Whatever those choices are, I am absolutely sure that if Singapore gets a dumb government, we are done for. This country will sink into nothingness."


"our low birth rates have nothing to do with economic or financial factors, such as high cost of living or lack of government help for parents. They are instead the result of changed lifestyles and mindsets."

"The total fertility rate per woman came down to a low of 1.15 in 2010, from close to 2.0 in the late 1980s. The replacement level is 2.1. There is a minor increase in births every time the Year of the Dragon comes around on the Chinese calendar (1988, 2000, 2012), but this spike has been shrinking, in line with the long-term downtrend."

"At the current fertility level and without immigration, the burden of an ageing population on the young will become unbearable within one generation. The number of working-age adults supporting each citizen aged 65 and above will fall from 5.9 in 2012 to 2.1 in 2030. Only the pandas are in a similar situation on the question of reproduction - and they do not have to worry about whether there are enough resources to ensure their seniors will be taken care of."

"Changed lifestyles have taken hold of developed societies everywhere in the world, from Japan to Europe. Once women are educated and have equal job opportunities, they no longer see their primary role as bearing children or taking care of the household. "

"Singaporeans have strong reservations about admitting immigrants, but we arrive at this option almost by process of elimination."
- politically digestible
- at scale that is culturally assimilating
- immigrants do not boost fertility rate

There are limitations to immigration, but there are no short term alternative otherwise.

"If I had to identify one issue that threatens Singapore's survival the most, it would be this one."

"The Chinese, with the one-child policy, will regret bitterly when they find one child having to support four grandparents."


"Singapore has a very open economy. From the moment we were separated from Malaysia, it was destined that, as a port city cut off from its natural hinterland, we had no way to develop other than to create very extensive links with the rest of the world."

"Unfortunately, as we continue to thrive, we will be confronted by a widening income gap. The problem is not peculiar to Singapore. In a globalised world, the nature of competition is such that the wages of those at the bottom get depressed and those at the top, who are mobile and much sought after, enjoy ever larger pay packets.

"I am opposed to too much interference with the free market. This distorts incentives and creates inefficiencies that are much harder to root out later. The minimum wage is one example of that. A far better approach would be to allow the free market to run its course and achieve the most optimal outcome in terms of total economic output before having the government step in at the end of that process to tax the rich to give to the poor."

"Q: What about PM Lee Hsien Loong's generation? My point is, maybe the decision to come back is not merely one of economic opportunity.
A: No, the only reason that will bring them back is their parents.
Q: That's one big reason. But how about a sense of patriotism, or a sense of having something to contribute to the land?
A: You're talking about a globalised world. The world is their oyster."

### Middle East

"The Middle East region lacks a history of counting heads and making decisions on that basis. There is no democratic tradition – whether in ancient Islamic times, in more recent colonial history, or in the post-colonial nationalistic era. When the British and French protectorates broke up into separate states, they all ended up with one-man rule – not by coincidence, but for deep cultural and sociological reasons."

"On top of not having any prior experience in representative forms of politics, the Middle East also lacks of vital social factors that form the foundation on which democracy must stand."

"The first is a sense of equal citizenship. This is the idea that you and I, despite all our differences in wealth, social standing, achievement, physical and mental attributes, and so on, are on par at some level for no reason other than that we are both citizens of a particular nation."

"This concept necessarily precedes the development of actual democratic practices and institutions."

"This ingredient is what I call the wherewithal to make real economic progress.
The ability is missing simply because they have insisted on keeping women in the background."

"They are building conference halls and palaces to generate goodwill so that they can get more oil and other primary resources."


"With every passing day, a permanent resolution to the conflict becomes less likely.
The United Nations has declared the Israeli settlements a violation of international law, describing them as a "creeping annexation".
The Israelis, however, know that such declarations are toothless unless they are endorsed by the Americans"

"All of this is doing America no good in the long run. It erodes the superpower's overall credibility and roils up the whole Arab world against the Americans."

"One country that would prefer to jeopardise any such peace deal is Iran. The Iranian government has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the destruction of the state of Israel."

### Looking forward

"The capitalist system is not fundamentally defective. Despite the growing rhetoric in some quarters, it does not need to be overturned or rebuilt."

"In the long run, the world is better off and will grow much quickly under capitalism because the free market is the most efficient way of organizing the productive forces in any society, as history has clearly proven."

"Critics who subscribe to the views of the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek believe such policies prevent fat in the economy from being trimmed, prolongs the life of inept companies and industries, and ultimately do nothing more than kick the can down the road. Natural adjustments to the economy must come eventually, they say, and blocking that through quantitative easing at best prolongs the necessary adjustment process and at worst builds inefficiencies into the system that will ultimately result in long-term sluggishness, if not a bigger recession later on.

I believe having supportive policies, monetary or Keynesian, to deal with crises is the lesser of two evils. Many countries tried the Hayekian approach of basically doing nothing during the Great Depression-with disastrous consequences. Thanks to the highly integrated global trade system we have in this day and age, the risk of a worldwide tightening with knock-on effects for every continent was a terrifying prospect for all. Nobody, therefore, wanted America to experience a hard landing."


"The US is able to carry out quantitative easing because its dollar happens to be the world's reserve currency. They are allowed to run a deficit for a long time with very few consequences. If other countries were to do that, they run the risk of capital outflow and exchange rate collapse. The cost is low to the Americans because some of what of what have cost a regular country has been transferred to the rest of the world. The Americans can borrow at more favourable interest rates because of a greater willingness by people elsewhere to hold cash reserves and assets in US dollars. That is the advantage of being the reserve currency."

"For now, the bigger short-term threat to the health of the global economy is a clampdown on free trade. We will always be just one protectionist wave away from a slowdown. We must never forget that the Great Depression of the 1930s was worsened by the isolationist tendencies among several countries. If America's politicians, for example, decide, perhaps out of electoral calculations, to impose a prohibitive tax on the Chinese for selling their goods under cost price, there will be some form of retaliation. Once you go down that route, it would not be long before other trading partners, including Europe and Japan, find themselves pulled into the conflict and having to consider similar measures. Then the whole trade system goes down by several degrees. The world will end up poorer overall. In many cases, it is the poor countries that will be hardest hit. Starting from lower bases, they stand to gain a lot more from trade, proportionally."



"On the Asian side of the Pacific, even though growth will be robust, it will be many decades before consumption comes close to the levels seen in the United States. There are cultural reasons for this. The Chinese have lived through natural disasters, wars and great uncertainty, when the individual or the family had to be self-reliant, falling back on whatever had been saved up during the good times. It will not be easy to convince them to become free spenders. Singapore, similarly, has set aside large reserves because of a cultural affinity towards staying prepared for rainy days."

"Another downside of globalisation is the tendency for inequality to breed. The most talented individuals are mobile and can make a good living in many parts of the world. The drive to pay these individuals very high salaries therefore becomes impossible for companies to resist if they want to retain them."

"Ways must be found to make sure even those at the bottom can maintain a decent standard of living and feel a sense of belonging to their community."



"You accept the world as it is, and find the best way of maximising your fortunes as a society, or you are left behind by the relentless pace of change found everywhere else. The world cannot possibly stop spinning for your sake."


"Global warming and climate change threaten human survival. This calls for governments to act together to cut total emissions significantly. Unfortunately, it is very unlikely that this will happen. In 2009, The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen ended without a binding agreement, despite the gathering of the leaders of all the important players. Subsequent conferences have not achieved spectacular results, nor would I hold my breath for future ones to do so.

At the heart of the issue is the perceived unavoidable trade-off between cutting emissions and growing the economy. When a government comes to the negotiating table, it knows it cannot move too far ahead of its domestic population when it makes concessions. If the pain inflicted on incomes and jobs is too much to take, it risks getting booted out of office."

"How do we put a stop to the relentless growth? The key, in my view, lies in educating women - which causes them to want fewer children. The sooner we are able to do this, the sooner we will have a less populated world."

"That explains the rise of environmental consciousness in China. They know that if they continue to produce at current energy efficiency levels, they will never hit America's GDP per capita because there simply isn't that much energy available to them. Furthermore, they can see their own people suffering from air and water pollution and their own environment changing in frightening ways. Respiratory diseases are on the rise. Sandstorms are becoming more frequent. The glaciers of the Tibetan plateau are receding every year."

"shale gas promises to make the North Americans energy independent - an unprecedented feat."

"Without that, I would not be in my present condition physically. It is a discipline."

"You must meet people, because you must have human contact if you want to broaden your perspective."

"I try not to meet only old friends or political leaders, but people from a variety of fields, such as academics, businessmen, journalists and ordinary people."

"Eventually, it was the market value of an education in English that settled the problem. Hence, we have today's Singapore, with English connecting us to the world and attracting the multinational corporations, and the mother tongues as second language keeping us linked to China, India and Indonesia. This was a critical turning point. Had the people chosen the other path, Singapore would be a backwater."

"I am not given to making sense out of life - or coming up with some grand narrative on it - other than to measure it by what you think you want to do in life. As for me, I have done what I had wanted to, to the best of my ability. I am satisfied."

"In the end, my greatest satisfaction in life comes from the fact that I have spent years gathering support, mustering the will to make this place meritocratic, corruption-free and equal for all races - and that it will endure beyond me, as it has"

"Singapore, as it stands, is the one corruption-free spot in a region where corruption is endemic. The institutions have been created to keep it that way, with the anti-corruption bureau. People are promoted on the basis of merit, not of race, language or religion. If we uphold these institutions, we will continue to make progress. That is my greatest hope."


"I think to be able to achieve anything, you must first gain the trust of the people - that you are not just making promises or pleasantries, that you mean what you say. And while you may succeed or you may fail, you will try and do what you have said. And that was the reason why I was able to succeed, because in several major instances, I carried out what I promises to do in spite of opposition."

"The Americans became involved not because of democracy and human rights, but because they did not want to see a Europe which was under such a powerful ideology which would threaten them"

"Well, it depends on what you think life is about. I mean, if I want to lead a happy personal life, then I would have remained a lawyer and a businessman and today I would be very much wealthier than I am. But I did not set out to do that. I saw a situation which I thought was wrong and I sought to put it right and I have the satisfaction of seeing better-fed people, better housing, everybody owning their own home, everybody having children who go to school, better health services, recreational facilities, all they could ask for in life. The problem is they now take it for granted and they believe that we can go on autopilot. I don't think so. I think if the government falls into bad hands, bad leaders, it will gradually regress. There is no such thing as flying at maximum speed, autopilot."
