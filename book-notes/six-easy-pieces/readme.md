# Six Easy Pieces

The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: the test of all knowledge is experiment.
Experiment is the sole judge of scientific 'truth'.
Where do the laws to be tested come from? Experiment, itself, helps to produce these laws, in the sense that it gives us hints.
But also needed is imagination to create from these hints the great generalizations.

### Atomic hypothesis

All things are made of **atoms**, little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.

Another way to remember molecules' size is this: if an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple. `(10^-8cm)`

**Pressure**: the molecules, being separated from one another, will bounce against the walls.
Imagine a room with a number of tennis balls (a hundred or so) bouncing around in perpetual motion. When they bombard the wall, this pushes the wall away.

If we consider the true nature of the forces between the atoms, we would expect a slight decrease in pressure because of the attraction between the atoms, and a slight increase because of the finite volume they occupy.

Nevertheless, to an excellent approximation, if the density is low enough that there are not many atoms, the pressure is proportional to the density.

If we increase the speed of the atoms, what is going to happen to the pressure?
Well, the atoms hit harder because they are moving faster, and in addition they hit more often, so the pressure increases.

What happens when an atom hits a compressing piston? It picks up speed from the collision.

So the atoms are “hotter” when they come away from the piston than they were before they struck it.
Therefore all the atoms which are in the vessel will have picked up speed.
**This means that when we compress a gas slowly, the temperature of the gas increases.**
So, under slow compression, a gas will increase in temperature, and under slow expansion it will decrease in temperature.

The interesting point is that the material (ice, solid) has a definite place for every atom, and you can easily appreciate that if somehow or other we were to hold all the atoms at one end of the drop in a certain arrangement, each atom in a certain place, then because of the structure of interconnections, which is rigid, the other end miles away (at our magnified scale) will have a definite location.

**The difference between solids and liquids** is, then, that in a solid the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called a crystalline array, and they do not have a random position at long distances; the position of the atoms on one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of the crystal.

**Why ice shrinks when it melts?**

The particular crystal pattern (hexagon) of ice shown here has many "holes" in it, as does the true ice structure.
When the organization breaks down, these holes can be occupied by molecules.
Most simple substances, with the exception of water and type metal, expand upon melting, because the atoms are closely packed in the solid crystal and upon melting need more room to jiggle around, but an open structure collapses, as in the case of water.

**What is the heat in the case of ice?**

The atoms are not standing still. They are jiggling and vibrating.
So even though there is a definite order to the crystal — a definite structure — all of the atoms are vibrating "in place".
As we increase the temperature, they vibrate with greater and greater amplitude, until they shake themselves out of place.
We call this melting.
As we decrease the temperature, the vibration decreases and decreases until, at absolute zero, there is a minimum amount of vibration that the atoms can have, but not zero.

Helium, even at absolute zero, does not freeze, unless the pressure is made so great as to make the atoms squash together. If we increase the pressure, we can make it solidify.

### Atomic processes

**What happens at the surface of the water?**

Above the surface we find a number of things:
* First of all there are water molecules, as in steam. This is water vapor, which is always found above liquid water.
* In addition we find some other molecules: here two oxygen atoms stuck together by themselves, forming an oxygen molecule, there two nitrogen atoms also stuck together to make a nitrogen molecule.
* The molecules in the water are always jiggling around. From time to time, one on the surface happens to be hit a little harder than usual, and gets knocked away. Thus, molecule by molecule, the water disappears — it evaporates.
But if we close the vessel above, after a while we shall find a large number of molecules of water amongst the air molecules. From time to time, one of these vapor molecules comes flying down to the water and gets stuck again.
Why do we see no change? Because just as many molecules are leaving as are coming back!

If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced because there are so many fewer water molecules above the water.
Therefore there are more going out than coming in, and the water evaporates. Hence, if you wish to evaporate water turn on the fan!

**Which molecules leave?**

When a molecule leaves it is due to an accidental, extra accumulation of a little bit more than ordinary energy, which it needs if it is to break away from the attractions of its neighbors. Therefore, since those that leave have more energy than the average, the ones that are left have less average motion than they had before. So **the liquid gradually cools if it evaporates.**

Of course, when a molecule of vapor comes from the air to the water below there is a sudden great attraction as the molecule approaches the surface. This speeds up the incoming molecule and results in generation of heat. So when they leave they take away heat; when they come back they generate heat.
Of course when there is no net evaporation the result is nothing — the water is not changing temperature. If we blow on the water so as to maintain a continuous preponderance in the number evaporating, then the water is cooled. Hence, blow on soup to cool it!

Of course you should realize that the processes just described are more complicated than we have indicated. Not only does the water go into the air, but also, from time to time, one of the oxygen or nitrogen molecules will come in and “get lost” in the mass of water molecules, and work its way into the water. Thus the air dissolves in the water; oxygen and nitrogen molecules will work their way into the water and the water will contain air.
If we suddenly take the air away from the vessel, then the air molecules will leave more rapidly than they come in, and in doing so will make bubbles.

In passing, we mention that the concept of a molecule of a substance is only approximate and exists only for a certain class of substances.
It is clear in the case of water that the three atoms are actually stuck together. It is not so clear in the case of sodium chloride in the solid. There is just an arrangement of sodium and chlorine ions in a cubic pattern. There is no natural way to group them as "molecules of salt."

Where the atoms do change combinations, chemical reaction; where they do not, physical processes, but there is no sharp distinction between the two.

**Burning carbon**

Carbon attracts oxygen much more than oxygen attracts oxygen or carbon attracts carbon. Therefore in this process the oxygen may arrive with only a little energy, but the oxygen and carbon will snap together with a tremendous vengeance and commotion, and everything near them will pick up the energy. A large amount of motion energy, kinetic energy, is thus generated.
This of course is burning: we are getting heat from the combination of oxygen and carbon. The heat is ordinarily in the form of the molecular motion of the hot gas, but in certain circumstances it can be so enormous that it generates light. That is how one gets flames.

### Chap 2

Is the sand other than the rocks?
That is, is the sand perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones?
Is the moon a great rock?
If we understood rocks, would we also understand the sand and the moon?
Is the wind a sloshing of the air analogous to the sloshing motion of the water in the sea?
What common features do different movements have?
What is common to different kinds of sound?
How many different colors are there? And so on.

In this way we try gradually to analyze all things, to put together things which at first sight look different, with the hope that we may be able to reduce the number of different things and thereby understand them better.

A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to find partial answers to such questions.
Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we call **the scientific method**.

The role of physics and the scientific method, with the analogy of watching gods play chess and trying to guess the rules.
We may derive that a bishop always stay in a red square, until we find one on a black square (e.g., pawn queening).

That is the way it is in physics.
For a long time we will have a rule that works excellently in an overall way, even when we cannot follow the details, and then sometime we may discover a new rule.
From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting phenomena are of course in the new places, the places where the rules do not work—not the places where they do work!
That is the way in which we discover new rules.

How do we tell if our guesses of the rules are correct?
* First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules work.
* A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules derived from them.
* The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough approximation. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine moves this particular piece, perhaps we can roughly understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or less, without being able to see what every little piece is doing, in terms of our understanding of the game.

Amalgamation of various seemingly disparate aspects (e.g. of heat and mechanics; relation between electricity, magnetism, and light) is what a theoretical physicist does, the process itself just like the confluence of seemingly disjoint areas.

The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to amalgamate everything, and merely discover that this world represents different aspects of one thing?
Nobody knows. All we know is that as we go along, we find that we can amalgamate pieces, and then we find some pieces that do not fit, and we keep trying to put the jigsaw puzzle together.
Whether there are a finite number of pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, are of course unknown.

Before 1920, our world picture was something like this: The “stage” on which the universe goes is the three-dimensional space of geometry, as described by Euclid, and things change in a medium called time.
The elements on the stage are particles, for example the atoms, which have some properties.
* First, the property of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless forces act upon it.
* The second element, then, is forces, which were then thought to be of two varieties:
  * First, an enormously complicated, detailed kind of interaction force which held the various atoms in different combinations in a complicated way, which determined whether salt would dissolve faster or slower when we raise the temperature.
  * The other force that was known was a long-range interaction—a smooth and quiet attraction—which varied inversely as the square of the distance, and was called gravitation. This law was known and was very simple. Why things remain in motion when they are moving, or why there is a law of gravitation, was, of course, not known.

What kinds of particles are there?
There were considered to be 92 at that time: 92 different kinds of atoms were ultimately discovered.
They had different names associated with their chemical properties.

The next part of the problem was, what are the short-range forces?
Why does carbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but not three oxygens?
What is the machinery of interaction between atoms?
Is it gravitation?
The answer is no. Gravity is entirely too weak.
But imagine a force analogous to gravity, varying inversely with the square of the distance, but enormously more powerful and having one difference.
In gravity everything attracts everything else, but now imagine that there are two kinds of “things,” and that this new force (which is the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes repel but unlikes attract. The “thing” that carries this strong interaction is called charge.

To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravitation, consider two grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart. If the force between them were not balanced, if everything attracted everything else instead of likes repelling, so that there were no cancellations, how much force would there be? There would be a force of three million tons between the two!

With this picture the atoms were easier to understand.
They were thought to have a **nucleus** at the center, which is positively electrically charged and very massive, and the nucleus is surrounded by a certain number of **electrons** which are very light and negatively charged.
Now we go a little ahead in our story to remark that in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of particles, protons and neutrons, almost of the same weight and very heavy.
The **protons** are electrically charged and the **neutrons** are neutral. If we have an atom with six protons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded by six electrons (the negative particles in the ordinary world of matter are all electrons, and these are very light compared with the protons and neutrons which make nuclei), this would be atom number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon.

Electric force, electromagnetic field, electromagnetic waves, waves of different frequency, and when at very high frequency, a wave behaves much more like particles!

This is **quantum mechanics**, discovered just after 1920, which explains this strange behavior.
In the years before 1920, the picture of space as a three-dimensional space, and of time as a separate thing, was changed by Einstein, first into a combination which we call space-time, and then still further into a curved space-time to represent gravitation.
So the “stage” is changed into space-time, and gravitation is presumably a modification of space-time.

Then it was also found that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect.
The mechanical rules of “inertia” and “forces” are wrong—Newton’s laws are wrong—in the world of atoms.
Instead, it was discovered that things on a small scale behave nothing like things on a large scale.
That is what makes physics difficult—and very interesting.
It is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so “unnatural”; we have no direct experience with it.
Here things behave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behavior in any other than analytic ways.
It is difficult, and takes a lot of imagination.

Quantum mechanics has many aspects. In the first place, **the idea that a particle has a definite location and a definite speed is no longer allowed; that is wrong.**

This rule is the explanation of a very mysterious paradox: if the atoms are made out of plus and minus charges, why don’t the minus charges simply sit on top of the plus charges (they attract each other) and get so close as to completely cancel them out? Why are atoms so big? Why is the nucleus at the center with the electrons around it?
It was first thought that this was because the nucleus was so big; but no, the nucleus is very small.
An atom has a diameter of about 10^–8 cm. The nucleus has a diameter of about 10^–13 cm.
If we had an atom and wished to see the nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but very nearly all the weight of the atom is in that infinitesimal nucleus.

**What keeps the electrons from simply falling in?**

This principle: if they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and **the uncertainty principle** would then require that they have a very large (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large kinetic energy.
With this energy they would break away from the nucleus.
They make a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance with this rule. (Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute zero, we said that the atoms do not stop moving, they still jiggle. Why? If they stopped moving, we would know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is against the uncertainty principle. We cannot know where they are and how fast they are moving, so they must be continually wiggling in there!)

One of the consequences is that things which we used to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. **There is no distinction between a wave and a particle.**

So quantum mechanics unifies the idea of the field and its waves, and the particles, all into one.
Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the field aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate description in terms of everyday experiences.
But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more evident with the equipment with which we usually make the measurements.

The new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically correct, is called **quantum electrodynamics**.
This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics.

### The nuclei

What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together?
It is found that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms.

Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together seem to be the fundamental constituents of matter.
Fortunately, these particles are not all different in their interactions with one another.
In fact, there seem to be just four kinds of interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasing strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay interaction, and gravity.
