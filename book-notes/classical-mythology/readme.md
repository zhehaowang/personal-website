Hesiod Theogony, Work and Days

Chaos
Gaia, Tartarus, Eros, Erebus, Hemera, Nyx
Uranus - Gaia
Cronus - Rhea
Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter

Hestia is rarely mentioned in literature, almost negligible in mythology, but presumably very important in religion.

Zeus - Hera
Ares (whom everyone hates), Enyo, Hebe, Eileithyia (childbirth), Eris (discord), Hephaestus (Hera by herself)

Zeus - Metis (wisdom)
Athena (from Zeus's head. Zeus swallows Metis who gave birth to Athena inside Zeus. Metis's son is prophecied to overthrow Zeus. One of the rare cases where gods / mortals cheat fate. Greeks believed thoughts / wisdom comes from the torso, and Metis gave counsel to Zeus from inside his belly.)

In men's meeting with gods at Mecone to decide sacrifice, Prometheus tried to trick Zeus into picking the pile of bones covered by meat and fat as sacrifice, and leaving the pile of meat covered by bones and unedible parts to human. Zeus knew and decided to punish Prometheus by punishing men, and took fire from them.
Prometheus later stole fire and gave it back to men, for which act he was chained to a pillar and have his liver grown everyday to be eaten by an eagle. Zeus punished men, too, for Prometheus stealing fire, by giving men the first woman, named Pandora in Work and Days.
Heracles rescued Prometheus from the chain.

Greek gods have little care for human beings, 

While these are from Theogony, many anecdotes / stories we hear today are actually from Ovid's metamorphoses.

Demeter, Persephone, the Eleusinian Mysteries, seasons, and Greek view of life and death.

Persephone's abduction by Hades and splitting her time in the underworld vs mount Olympus resulted in the seasons where one third of the year crops don't grow.
As told by the Homeric hymn on Demeter (Homeric in time and style but not by Homer), during Demeter's search for Persephone, she visited Eleusis disguised as a crone and babysitted the queen's son, whom she intended to bring to immortality by annoiting and throwing into the fire. The plan was foiled by the queen who happened upon the ritual, angering Demeter and causing the death of the prince.
The Eleusinian Mysteries were a cult ritual dedicated to Demeter in which only the initiated were told of the rituals. Our view of what the ritual is about preserved from those of the potentially biased early Christian authors. Presumably symbolisms of life and death.

While the Greek view of afterlife is in general pretty grim: most men became shadows / images in the grim world of tartarus, except extraordinary souls or terrible sinners (e.g. tantalus who intended to trick the gods into eating flesh by serving his own son, whose shoulder only Demeter ate mistakenly, resulting in an ivory shoulder when the gods bring the son back); the Eleusinian Mysteries might have offered a brighter view.
Note that the general grim view differs from traditional belief of Christianity or Islam, in that the latter believes the afterlife / the eternal is the important part and the deeds of this life would affect that of the afterlife, while the former places its emphasis on this life and rarely consequences of one's deeds in this life.

Orphism is another cult dealing with life and death. The teaching of the mortal Orpheus (who, surprisingly some sources claim, is the child of Apollo and a muse) while in the underworld trying to bring back his dead wife Eurydice. Persuaded by his superb music, Hades and Persephone gave their consent on the condition that Orpheus does not look back when leading Eurydice out of the underworld, which he failed to do.
Reincarnation might have been a central concept in Orphism, which took a view like that of Buddhism, that reincarnation / cycle-after-cycle is something one wants to escape from, and one does it by saying certain things to certain gods in the underworld.


Apollo and Artemis
Children of Zeus and Leto (who is of little mythological importance otherwise)
Apollo him of medicine and plague, youth and sudden death (struck by the arrow of Apollo), all the creative arts (administers over the Muses), rationality, prophesy (delegated by Zeus), and later on associated with the Sun.
Depicted as a male in 20s with bow and quiver showing that of typical youthful manly beauty.
Pythia (prietess of the Oracle of Delphi) delivers the words of Apollo to those seeking prophesy, which are most of the time ambiguous in nature, e.g. Croesus of Lydia was told if he attacks the Persians he would destroy a great empire (that of his own).
Motto at the Oracle of Delphi; know yourself, nothing in excess. Know yourself in the sense of knowing your limitations and not offend the god. (Queen of Thebes suggesting she should be worshipped for having 14 children while Leto only has two; and all her children were struck dead by Apollo and Artemis.)

Artemis the huntress, goddess of animals, the untamed, women before marriage, and the young.
Hestia, Artemis and Athena are chaste goddesses of Greek myths, in Artemis's case, it's potentially related with her representation of the untamed: sex is viewed as domination, and one Greek way of saying wife came from the word tamed.
Her association with hunting is also related with protection of the young, which hunters often times do for sustainability.
Most famous place of worship in Turkey; temple at Ephesus.

Hermes and Dionysus
Hermes God of exchange, of commerce, trading, thieves, beggars, boundaries, the messenger, and deliverers of souls to the underworld.
Hermes invented the lyre from tortoise shells, and traded it with Apollo for a cattle he stole from Apollo in the first place.
The pillar herma is associated with Hermes: herma represents boundaries (those of a market, e.g.) and usually depicts a bearded god with an erect phallus. The pillar is sacred and their mass destruction before Alcibiades's expedition to Syracuse was a serious matter that caused his investigation.

Dionysus of madness, irrationality, frenzy, growth of wild plants and wine.
Male worshippers Satyrs human with beast features such as years, horse tails, and later on goat below the waist, always in a frenzy; female worshipers maenad human women who has the strength to tear wild animals apart.
Nietzsche find greek culture often times representing the contrast of Apollonian reason and Dionysian madness.
Dionysus is often associated with tragic and comedian traditions of Athens, perhaps due to their origins in rituals and actors impersonating someone else bears some similarity to Dionysian irrationality.
Euripides's Bacchae describes birth of Dionysus: Zeus in disguise bedded mortal woman Semele, whose nanny Hera disguised as out of jealousy and suggested Semele verify her partner is indeed a god not a pretender, by asking him to swear on the river styx to fulfill one wish of Semele's, which Zeus did. Semele asks him to reveal his true glory, which incinerated her. Zeus took her embryo Dionysus and nurtured him in his thigh from where Dionysus is born. He is thus sometimes referred to as the twice born. The Theban siblings of Semele refused to acknowledge Dionysus's divine status, for this slight Dionysus drove the women of Thebes mad and tore apart the siblings.

Aphrodite of sexual passion.
Quite a different concept as modern perception of love, in its being transient.
Origined from Uranus's genitals in Theogony, or child of Zeus and Dione in Iliad.
Aeneas son of Anchises and Aphrodite (Zeus giving Aphrodite a taste of her own medicine. Gods, men and animals are said to be unable to resist Aphrodite's power, except the three chaste goddesses). Homeric hymn to Aphrodite tells the story of Anchises and Aphrodite, who lied to the former of being a mortal woman. Aeneas being the hero of Aeneid and claimed ancestor of Romans.
No good ever comes of the union between men and goddesses. Examples including Adonis killed for his relationship with Aphrodite, and Tithonus and Eos the goddess of dawn. Zeus agreed in Eos's plead to make Tithonus immortal but she forgot to ask for youth. Tithonus ages but never dies and eventually became just a babbling voice that Eos shut away.
Sexual relationship between an older man and an adolescent young man is often seen as ok in greek myths, but not other forms of homosexuality.

Maybe it does not make sense to ask the Greeks whether they believe in their gods, who are personifications of natural forces. To ask if an ancient Greek believes in Aphrodite would be like asking if he acknowledges the presence of sexual passion.
Belief in god(s) could be very much a monotheistic thing.
