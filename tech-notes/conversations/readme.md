Flow and spontaneity.

Improv performers as players on the same team, not vying for control or seeking discord.
You and your interlocutter are working together to make the experience enjoyable for both.

Yes, and...Not just yes.
Yes, really...Not no.

Listen, read and react.
Awareness of the signal they are sending, and the one you are sending.
Consider exaggerating your reaction a bit.

Be specific with your questions.
Did you like (particular movie) is easier to answer than what's your favorite movie.
The more variants left up for interpretation the harder your interlocutter has to think, and come back with less information. This hurts flow.
Be specific can be invasive, don't apply in a career fair scenario with folks you hardly know, don't be interrogative.

Mind the details. Where the details are in the other person's answer?

No "no". Avoid confrontational, defensive, close-minded responses.

Create motion in the topic. Weather, and the topics that can derive from, or are loosely related with weather.

Don't take yourself too seriously. Don't take the topic too seriously.
Talking about generic stuff (weather, work, current events) is easy, talking about controversial and less obvious topics could spark interest.
People are not as easily offended by certain topics. Maybe they are, use your best judgment but in general it seems helpful for us to loosen up.
Try less generic topics, spark conversation, play the devil's advocate.

Think on your feet.
Casual conversations need not be bound by an agenda, you are not here to show you are a walking encyclopedia, which is not fun.
Practice random topics, and imagining one word from another and making a story out of them.

Help your interlocutter.

Callback. Inside jokes, and shows you are paying attention.

Listen. It's not the same as waiting for your turn to speak. Listen attentively. 2:1.

HPM when you don't have something to say. H - personal experience with one element in the other person's dialogue, P - opinion, M - metaphor.
Use them but use them cautiously, try H Q Q Q M Q Q Q...


Try to flow before you try to be funny.

In a conversation, our attention could be split between paying attention to the other person and thinking up a response. Focus on the former.


The siren. Standing out physically. Voice and delivery. Dazzle and harmonious. Theatricality. Danger. Element of fear / mercurial mood. Unknown. A touch of madness. Irrationality.

The rake. The dangerous.

Each of us carries inside us an ideal: either of what we would like to become, or what we want another person to be for us. This ideal traces to our earliest years, what others could not give us, or what we could not give ourselves.
We may seek danger, or to be nobler, kinder, chivalrous, something we feel is missing inside us.
Atune to what is missing inside you.
The key is to observe. The ideal can often be concealed in contradiction.
