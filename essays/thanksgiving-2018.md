# Thanksgiving 2018

11/20/2018


It used to bewilder me why in China we don't seem to have a holiday dedicated to appreciating (the God and) those around us.
Perhaps we never celebrated a harvest, or the arrival of new immigrants, like the first Puritans did 400 years ago.
One so vital upon which the very survival of the colonies is contingent.

I've not been one to express gratitude verbally (or much to my distress, not many other positive feelings or compliments either for that matter).
Yet I do find myself constantly reflecting on the people and events of the past.
Usually no matter if those brought joy, anger or pain at the moment I experienced them, by the time of the reflection I feel gratitude: towards the much treasured memories we shared, or the bitter lessons they taught.

It is almost once again this time of the year, and in typing these down I would hope to make up for my lack of words.
No particular order would do these justice, perhaps the cliche alphabetical one is but the best I can do.


To Adam and Jochen, for their excellent advice on career, and on what I could have done better.

To Buyu, for putting up with my nonchalance and ambiguity, which I am now ashamed of.

To Chongshan, Dongjie, Zhongxia and Jian, for all the fun in our first reunion in four years.
And dragging me to a net cafe, not something I'm particularly proud of but another first nonetheless.

To Fei, Li, and Sergii, for their willingness to help and share their knowledge, and the time they generously invested in me.

To Janani, for always being encouraging and comforting to talk to.
Often times I don't see myself share this much with friends.
A change for the better, I suppose.

To Jiajun and Josh, for sharing their knowledge and motivating each other on the similar path we undertook.

To Jian, Ken, and others of Jump, for the many Friday nights we spent discussing papers / technologies of mutual interest.
Perhaps one of those was my finest moment this year.

To Joseph, David, Erin, Kevin, Kai, Kim and many others at HRT, for the fun interviews and events.
Also for inspiring me to keep improving, to remain humble and not get satisfied with my few achievements.

To Joseph, for being an outstanding conversationist and lunch pal.

To Nikhil and Shawn, for their encouragement and support on my decision to leave earlier.
A shame the way it turned out.

To Ning, for the gifts and few interactions in a foreign office.
In the past year, those days, if not now, were perhaps the ones during which I was most troubled.

To Nzo, for always being there to bounce ideas with.
Even those "evil", unethical and silly ones.
Perhaps not many are lucky enough to share such an acquaintance.

To Ponjo, for being a genuine friend, someone to share happiness, experience, or simply programming techniques with.

To Sam, Eduardo, Rayna, Jason and others who bombarded LinkedIn / Inbox, for reaching out and reminding me how much more there is to explore out there.

To Setty, for the day hikes we went on, the trips to Chicago and CDMX, the arguments we had, and the many sentiments we shared.
From my disappointment in Februrary, the anxiety in April and May, the exhilaration in July till September, and the deep concerns now.

To Sophia, for helping me realize how much I should treasure the opportunities now, and wanting to work harder to be worthy of what luck has graciously gifted me with.

To Yao, for keeping my ego in check at work.

To those I met in my travels this and the last year, for making me feel at home in foreign lands.

To my parents, always.

And to the many unnamed, for your kindness, patience, support, or simply your smile at a stranger in distress.


I was treated by this world with kindness, for that I constantly remind myself to pay it forward.

I find myself again at a crossroads, perhaps making questionable decisions.
Even if the path may turn out to be a dead end, work hard, learn, stay humble, and appreciate.
