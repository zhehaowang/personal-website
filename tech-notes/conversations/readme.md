Flow and spontaneity.

Improv performers as players on the same team, not vying for control, seeking discord or anything. You and your interlocutter are working together to make the experience enjoyable for both.

Yes, and...Not just yes.
Yes, really...Not no.

Listen, read and react.
Awareness of the signal they are sending, and the one you are sending.
Consider exaggerating your reaction a bit.

Be specific with your questions.
Did you like (particular movie) is easier to answer than what's your favorite movie.
The more variants left up for interpretation the harder your interlocutter has to think, and come back with less information. This hurts flow.
Be specific can be invasive, don't apply in a career fair scenario with folks you hardly know, don't be interrogative.

Mind the details. Where the details are in the other person's answer?

No "no". Avoid confrontational, defensive, close-minded responses.

Create motion in the topic. Weather, and the topics that can derive from, or are loosely related with weather.
