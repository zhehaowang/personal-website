Although we are young, and the cost of making sub-optimal choices is relatively small, but with each choice there still is a cost.
Now that I think of it, miss the chance to go to Tsinghua / CMU / Google / ... once, we probably miss it for life.
The impact magnifies through time, leading one down different paths in life...maybe diverging farther from the goal we set out to achieve, if there ever was one.
At some point one settles down, becomes satisfied and loses the mettle. When that day comes and I think back, I just want to reassure myself I did everything I could, and worked hard for everything I believed right.

At a game, as well as at other things: a big difference is whether there is a purpose in mind.
Today Iâ€™ve a goal to improve my skills.
What do I want to learn and internalize today? How do I achieve that? Did I manage to achieve it?

There were times in games when I thought "why don't you noobs get good", then I realized it's just different life priorities. Some play to have fun, some play to win.
I'm still in the middle of figuring out why I play, and along that process we found a few things that might make a difference. Now is just as good a time as any to do those.
