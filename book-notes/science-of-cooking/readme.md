# Science of cooking

### Elements of taste

* salty, to keep internal salt level balanced
* sweet, indicating easy to digest
* bitter, potentially harmful, danger alert
* sour, acids, source of vitamin C, or has gone bad
* umami, (鲜), protein indication
* fatty, indicating rich energy

### Maillard reaction

Chemical reaction starting at 140 C / 284 F between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its distinctive flavor. (fuse / new flavor and aromatic substances.)
Seared steaks, crispy fish skin, fried dumplings, cookies and other kinds of biscuits, breads, toasted marshmallows, and many other foods undergo this reaction.

Since this happens beyond boiling point of water, the surface moisture needs to be driven off by heat first.

Intensifies (twice as quickly) at 150 C / 302 F, peaks at 160 C / 320 F.

**Pyrolysis** (burning) starts at 180 C / 356 F, food chars and becomes bitter.
Carbs, proteins, and then fat breaks down, leaving harmful substance.

### Pairing

Each food has characteristic flavor compounds, the chemicals that lend it its aroma, pungency, and taste.

Shared flavor compounds can often serve as basis for pairing (roasted beef with onion / wheat / butter / beer / peanut butter / mushrooms / coffee).

However, the theories do not account for a food's texture and don't always hold true for Asian and Indian cuisines, where spice combinations have very few or no flavor links.

### Knives

Material
* carbon steel
* stainless steel (with chromium)
* ceramic

Collection
* Serrated knife (Foods that have a tough crust or smooth, delicate skin, such as bread, cake, or large tomatoes where precision isn’t required.)
* Chef's knife (Finely slicing, dicing, disjointing large cuts of meat, and crushing garlic cloves with the side of the blade.)
* Paring knife (Slicing, peeling, coring, and delicate work such as stripping out vanilla beans.)
* Carving knife (Making thin cuts of meat from a large cut.)

### Pots and pans

Material
* Stainless steel (conducts heat poorly, food sticks easily.)
* Copper (heavy and expensive, conducts heat well, reacts to acid and needs coating.)
* Aluminum (conducts heat quickly and loses heat quickly off stove, lightweight, has coating)
* Carbon steel (heats up faster than stainless, but reacts to acid and rusts.)
* Cast iron (Very heavy, cast iron is dense and heats slowly, but, once heated, it retains heat well and is ideal for browning meat in a skillet or casserole. Also reacts with acid so season it, coat with protective nonstick seal and clean carefully. Avoid abrasive cleaners.)

**Pan's thickness**: the thicker the base, the more evenly the heat from the burner spreads across it.

Collection
* Wok
  * Stir-frying over the hottest flame, steaming, and deep-fat frying.
  * A tight-fitting lid, a thin base, and long sturdy handle. Avoid nonstick, which won’t tolerate high stir-frying heats. Carbon steel is ideal; to season it, scrub off the existing oil coat, heat to blacken, add oil to smoke, then rub off the oil when cool. Do this 3–4 times before use.
* Cast-iron skillet
  * Root veg, meats, sticky foods (if seasoned), putting under the broiler and in the oven.
  * A long, heat-proof handle (cast iron retains heat) and a grip handle to aid in lifting.
* Round casserole dish
  * Slow-braising meats.
  * A tight-fitting lid and easy-to-grasp handles. Although heavy, cast iron is ideal because it keeps a steady temperature, and an enamel interior is durable and doesn’t react with acids.
* Saucepan
  * Sauces, stews, soups, stocks, boiling vegetables, rice, and pasta.
  * Lids to retain moisture, and an extra small-grip handle on large pans to aid in lifting. Heat-proof handles are oven-friendly.
* 10in / 24cm frying pan
  * Delicate fish, eggs, and crêpes.
  * A thick base and thick nonstick coat—choose from a reputable supplier.
* 12in / 30cm saute pan
  * Searing and frying large batches; creating sauces and large meals.
  * A tight-fitting lid to hold moisture, a long handle, and a moderately heavy base.

### Utensils

Tools. (Not every invention is a step forwards—pay attention to how versatile it is and how the material works with different ingredients.)

* Measuring cup
* Digital scale
* Honing steel
* Rolling pin
* Balloon whisk
* Grater
* Metal sieve
* Slotted spoon
* Ladle
* Metal spatula (Sliding under delicate food)
* Thermometer (Look for one with a probe that can rest in a pan. Those that read to 410 F (210 C), can also be used for caramelizing sugar.)
* Rubber spatula (Delicate work)
* Wooden spoon (easy on the surface, poor conductor of heat, but it's a porous material and needs thorough cleaning!)
* Mixing bowl (Stainless steel lasts a long time, but can't be put in a microwave. Tempered glass is heat-resistant and microwave-friendly. Ceramic and stoneware can chip, are slow to warm, so ideal for working with dough.)
* Chopping board (Durable and good for all foods, wooden boards have "give" so they don't dull knives, unlike granite and glass. Plastic traps bacteria in grooves, while wood has bacteria-killing tannins, making it a hygienic choice.)

### Meat and poultry

All made of the same three tissues, varying proportions determine flavor and texture and its best culinary usage.
* Muscle.
  * Red or pink in color and makes up the bulk of most cuts of meat. 70 to 85 percent water—moisture that needs to be conserved to keep cooked meat juicy.
  * Made of thousands of hair-width strands, packed with moisture and protein.
  * Tender cuts need minimal cooking to retain moisture. Marbled muscle can be cooked slowly.
* Fat.
  * Usually tucked under the skin, along connective tissue, or around organs.
  * Chewy, bland and tasteless when uncooked, but imparts huge amounts of flavor when the fat cells burst open during cooking.
  * Each fat cell contains a droplet of oil which bursts open when heated, dissolving flavor molecules and giving meat a moist mouthfeel.
* Connective tissue.
  * Forms sheathes around muscle fibers and connects muscles to bone — it slowly breaks down during cooking, imparting rich flavor to meat dishes.
  * Made of protein that soften and break down when heated to 126 F / 52 C.
  * Long slow cooking transforms it into velvety gelatin, giving meat its succulence.

Know your white meat
* Chicken
  * Fat medium, protein high
  * Not high in fat, so it has a dry mouthfeel if overcooked. Cooking it in a sauce can help to introduce moisture.
* Duck
  * Fat medium, protein medium
  * Rich, dark duck meat has a thick layer of fat under the skin. Roasting, frying, or grilling works best; prick or score the skin first to help the fat melt.
* Turkey
  * Fat low, protein high
  * With lots of muscle and little fat, white turkey meat is good for stir-frying and grilling. The dark leg meat contains more connective tissue and can be stewed.

Choosing your white meat
* Breast meat should be firm and plump.
* Bones should be in-tact, not broken.
* Flesh should be blemish-free.
* The skin should be smooth and soft.

Know your red meat
* Beef
  * Fat high, protein medium
  * A cow's large endurance muscles produce dark, rich meat that suits both slow and fast cooking methods. Cuts that contain muscle marbled with fat will be more succulent.
* Lamb
  * Fat medium, protein medium
  * Fat provides lambs with their day-to-day fuel, so most cuts are marbled with fat. Lamb is suited to most methods of cooking, but the sinewy shoulder and leg cuts need to be cooked down slowly.
* Pork
  * Fat high, protein lowest
  * Ranging from pale pink to rose, pork cuts often have a thick layer of fat that helps keep the meat moist when cooking. Lean fillets and steaks require fast cooking methods to stop them from drying out.
* Venison
  * Fat low, protein high
  * As deer are ranging animals, deer meat contains more muscle and connective tissue than fat. Braise or stew small, lean cuts to conserve moisture, or roast large cuts, which will have a lot of connective tissue.

Choosing your red meat
* Fat enhances flavor. A yellow hue simply suggests the animal was grass-fed.
* The surface should be smooth and not appear sticky or slimy, which could suggest bacteria have proliferated on the surface.
* Meat should have a mild but not unpleasant smell.
* For tender cuts, choose one with a fine grain and little connective tissue. For tough cuts, the grain will be thicker, indicating the muscle was well-used.
* For stewing, look for cuts with fat and connective tissue.
* Marbling is a good sign that meat is full of flavor.

Color of the meat alone is not a reliable indicator of its quality.
* The natural color of meat comes from a red oxygen-carrying pigment, myoglobin, stored in the muscle tissue.
* The higher the levels of myoglobin, the darker and redder the meat, while lower levels of myoglobin result in paler meat.
* Red meat contains myoglobin more than white and older animals have higher levels, giving their meat a darker hue.
* The same animal may have varying levels of myoglobin in different muscles.
  * Dark "slow-twitch" muscles, like those in a leg, are for endurance and need a steady oxygen supply, so have more myoglobin. Whiter "fast-twitch" muscles, for short bursts of energy, need less oxygen, such as chicken breast muscles, designed for flapping wings.
  * Proportions of light and dark meat affect flavor and texture. Darker, well-exercised muscles tend to have more protein, fat droplets, iron, and flavor-generating enzymes. (generally higher levels intensifying flavor and lower levels creating a blander-tasting meat. Light meat needs extra flavoring. As animal grows myoglobin levels rise, muscles strengthen, and fat increases, adding to flavor.)
* Vacuum-packed meat deprived of oxygen has a natural purple tinge.
* Once in contact with air, myoglobin changes color, turning meat bright red. (If it stays purple, this suggests that the animal may have been stressed at slaughter and its meat will be dry and firm.)
* Myoglobin browns the longer it is exposed to oxygen.
* Red liquid pooling at the bottom of a package of meat isn't blood, but a mix of myoglobin and water.

##### Does organic matter?

Animals that have had enough exercise, have been well fed, and have been spared undue stress produce meat that has lots of well-textured muscle and flavorsome fat. Organic-status meat should help guarantee all of these things.
* Animals are raised on organic land and eat organic feed; however, this has little bearing on the quality of meat.
* Animals reared organically aren’t given antibiotics or growth-promoting hormones, although this is already the case for all cattle in many countries.
* Organic stock are more likely to have been slaughtered humanely, which produces better-quality meat. If an animal is stressed preslaughter, adrenaline levels surge, burning energy and producing dry, firm, dark meat.
* Being fed grass or grain has more impact on flavor.
  * Grain-fed muscle has more flavorful fat, is less acidic, and contains pleasant-tasting substances called lactones, while grass-fed cows' meat can have a bitter, grassy flavor.
  * Leaner grass-fed cows store their fat just under the skin. The meat of grain-fed cows tends to be well-marbled throughout.
* If meat isn’t stored or transported with care, this affects quality. High demand for organic means it can travel far and be stored for a long period of time. A nonorganic farm rearing humanely treated animals slaughtered and sold locally is likely to be superior.

##### Does heritage / breed matter?

Beef has a complex flavor, yet genetic differences lead to only subtle taste variations. Research consistently shows that the amount of marbling in any given cut is more important than the actual breed.

##### Do larger chicken lack flavor?

The modern "broiler" chicken is the result of decades of aggressive selective breeding.

The bird that is industrially farmed today is four times the size of those bred 50 years ago, reaches slaughter weight in just 35 days (less than half the time of traditional breeds), and is plagued with health problems due to its abnormal proportions.

Heritage breeds of chicken take longer to grow and are considerably more expensive, but research shows that the meat has a significantly richer flavor and better mouthfeel than intensively farmed chickens.
