# Controls in A7 II

### Camera modes

* Auto
* Program mode (P). Auto.
* Aperture Priority (A). Front dial controls aperture (camera controls shutter, iso)
  * Analogous to pupil.
  * Measured by. f/x, the smaller x, the bigger apperture (more light is let in), the more background blur (see depth-of-field). (f/1.8 - f/22).
* Shutter Priority (S). Front dial controls shutter (camera controls aperture, iso)
  * How long the shutter is open for. You can shoot in smallest shutter period possible, in which case camera will likely dial up iso, resulting in noises. To capture fast moving objects you generally want faster shutter speed.
  * Measured by seconds. E.g. 1/60s.
* Manual mode (M). Front dial controls aperture. Back dial controls shutter speed. (camera controls iso)
  * Can switch to bulb mode, where shutter can open for more than 30s by holding. (E.g. night sky)
* Video mode.

### Drive mode (shutter mode)

* Single shooting
* Continuous shooting
* Self timer setting

### Bracketing (HDR)

* E.g. 2ev 3img, takes 3 pictures at -2, 0, +2 (controls exposure, brighter or darker)
* Useful for HDR (high dynamic range), where you blend different exposures and take the best of each
* This camera has HDR built-in, but it may not do a good job

### Exposure compensation

* Exposure dial: decides the exposure (e.g. +2ev). Shift the light (exposure) histogram horizontally.

### Focusing mode

* Single-shot auto focus (AFS): once you focus (hold shoot half down), lock in focus even if you move the camera. Allows focus recompose.
* Continuous auto focus (AFC): as you move, refocus continuously. Not especially reliable. Can use for action.
* Dynamic manual focus (DMF): auto focus by default, but you can also grab the focus ring (lens) and focus manually.
* Manual focus (MF): disable auto focus. Disable auto focus. Does nothing when shoot half down.

### Focus area

* Wide: camera picks focus point for you
* Flexible spot: always focus on the area you choose
  * The smaller focus area, the easier to pin point something especially with a shallow depth of field, the longer the focus time
* Continuous focus
* Zone focus: e.g. left third
* Center focus

### Manual focus

* Manual focus assist: when Manual Focus is on, grabbing focus ring zooms in in monitor
* Focus peaking: colors what's in focus

### Adapting lenses

* APS-C size capture, auto lets the camera decides if the attached lens is APS-C, otherwise force full-frame
* Steady shots, if you attach a non-Sony lens, may need to set steady shots focal lens to manual to match your lens.

### Metering modes

Decides how the camera should auto adjust iso, etc
* Multi: default. Usually intelligent.
* Center
* Spot

### ISO

Sensitivty of your sensor. Given a certain shutter speed and aperture, low iso gives dark image, high iso gives bright image.
* Auto
* Manual, 12800, ..., 100, 50; higher iso has higher noise

### White balance

* Auto, cloudy, shade, daylight, etc. Doesn't matter when you shoot raw.

### Diopter

* Next to EVF, for glasses users looking through EVF.

### Shooting raw

* You can shoot raw or jpeg
* Choose in quality: raw, fine, jpeg, raw & jpeg
* Picasa, or Lightroom can work with raw

### Other settings

* Customize keys, customize
  * control wheel
  * buttons C1, C2, etc
  * which button focuses (back-button focus e.g.)
* Audio signals off (no focusing beeps)

# Concepts

### Depth of field

The range of distance in an image where the focus is acceptably sharp.
Lens focal length, apperture, and distance to your subject decides DoF.

* Short lens focal length: deep DoF, wide field of view, objects appear farther away from your subject
* Long lens focal length: shallow DoF, narrow field of view, objects appear closer to your subject
* Apperture: the wider the apperture, the shallower DoF
* Distance to subject: the closer you are to your subject, shallower DoF

DoF can be used to
* isolate your subject from other elements in a photo (e.g. portrait background blur),
* foreground blur, remove obstacles (e.g. fences),
* give better bokeh (visual quality of out-of-focus parts of an image: e.g. smooth circular light spots from an out-of-focus background)

### Exposure histogram, noise

##### Natural light in landscape photography

* Golden, sun being low, right after sunrise or before sunset. More directional. Think landscape with hills and textures upon which shadows are cast. Light and shadow, depth and drama. Clouds have similar effect: part of the scene are lit. Warm golden glow.
* Blue, right before sunrise or after sunset. Sun's below the horizon, light's reflected from the atmosphere, taking away contrast and evenly lit. Ambient, soft. Narrow time frame. 
* Flat, generally poor for landscape: not much contrast, depth. Overcast flat light can work in particular cases, e.g. with overcast cloud, on waterfalls. Consider desaturating, black and white to bring out the texture / mood of the scene.

### Lenses, landscape photography

Our eyes are used to seeing the world at around 50mm focal length, phone cameras capture images around 30mm.
To go below that with a short focal length wide-angle or a telephoto focal length can often reflect the world in ways our eyes were not used to seeing.
Wide-angle lens may make it harder to compose the image, a lot will be in your field of view, and you have a larger depth of field.
With a telephoto lens you are going to remove a lot of the context, e.g. creating an abstract image. Telephoto lens also pull distant things together.

Similarly, we are used to seeing the world 1.2m to 1.7m above the ground. When you get the camera lower or higher than that, it could also reflect the world in ways our eyes were not used to seeing.

If you are out and don't have the lens of the desired focal length with you, think differently and compose differently, move around, experiment.

### Misc

* In landscape photography, travel as light as possible: anything that dissuades you from moving is going to hurt, and your creativity / focus will be restricted if you are out of breath.

### Sharpness

### Mirrorless vs DSLR

Size, electronic / optical view finder, focus time, battery life, etc
