# Western music

Music as a mirror (think Beethoven's 2nd composed at the lowest of his lows, and bowel movement).

Western music. Constant change of style, role and identity of the composer, change of the subjects of our expression, and pace of change proportional to that of the society.

Social / cultural / religious traditions. The piece itself. Vocabulary (Conjunctive, disjunctive.)

### Greek Roman and early Christian

From 4000BC to 0AD, about 40 fragments of pieces of music (oral tradition, sometimes preserved on paper, e.g. an excerpt from Euripides' Orestes was found on a papyrus two hundred years after it was composed; the 1st Century AD Roman drinking song Seikilos epitaph, "don't worry, be happy") survived.

The humanistic musical ideals of the Greek, much like that of ours today.
The doctrine of ethos. Pythagoras. The mathematical ratios that governed the cosmos.

Monophonic. The instrument Cithara, a seven-string lyre.

The creators of opera in renaissance were convinced they were recreating Greek comedies / tragedies.

Musical corollary of the early church.
* Music for divine beauty.
* Music is a servant of religion. Strictly instrumental must be rejected. 
* Dancing is associated with Pagan traditions and must be rejected.

And the Greek humanistic tradition is lost.

### Medieval

##### Dark ages (~600 - ~1000)

Plain chant / Gregorian (Pope 590 - 604) chant.
* Hymns. Calm. Conducive to meditation and quietude. Smooth, conjunct, no regular beat, monophonic. Anonymous authors
* Mass

##### High medieval (~1000 - ~1400)

Improvement in public safety. Cities. Development in architecture, agricultural technology and secular courts.

Polyphony music. Two individual melodies at the same time.
With it comes the necessity for a musical notation, and soon came the identity of the composer, and music sets out on the path of being self-expressive.

First form, organum.
One melody to praise God, another of man to echo that of the God.

Florid (flowery) organum.
Old arts of the Notre-Dame school. Characteristics
* Stretched (long sustained tenor voice). Melisma (single word over multiple notes).
* Organ in the background.
* Hand of God.

##### 14th Century

Time of change.
Babylonian captivity. The Great Schism. The Black Death.

New arts of Notre-Dame school.
* Secular subjects. Isorhythmic (Pitch and rhythms are designed separately. Think multiple vocal tracks of multiple poems simultaneously). Structural complexity.

### Renaissance

Lost faith in church, classicism, trying to achieve what the Greeks once did in their music: expressive and being moved by their composition.

Emphasis on
* Articulation of words
* Music reflecting on the meaning of words
* Secular, humanistic subjects

This led to the rejection of melismatic, ornamental organum (one word over multple notes hurts articulation), as well as isorhythmic pattern from the last century.

Reinspection of Pythagoras's work on consonant and dissonant notes (notes that blend well vs not).
Harmony and tuning system.

(Pythagoras: pitch produced by a string of length 6 is an octave lower than the pitch produced by a string of length 3. The distance between pitch of length 3 is a "perfect 5th" away from pitch of length 2. The theory on harmonic series.)

A cappella: as in the chapel (without instrumental accompanying)

Major triads were explored during the Renaissance, the notes are conjunct.

The words are articulate but multiple voices are overlapping.
Machaut, Mass de Notre Dame.

Polyphony.

### Renaissance - mass

Mass got its name from missa in Latin "Ite, missa est" (the concluding act to dismiss the congregation).

The high mass has two major sections
* The liturgy of words
* The liturgy of eucharist (Greek for giving thanks)
and 17 (or more, depending on categorization) parts.

Two categories of activities:
* The proper, where texts differ from mass to mass
* The ordinary, where texts do not change

Renaissance composer had the choice to compose for the former or the latter, and they chose the latter.

Parts in the second category include Kyrie, Gloria, Credo (in the liturgy of words), and Sanctus (divine), Agnus Dei (lamb of God), ite missa est (in liturgy of the eucharist).

High Renaissance composers unified the ordinary of a mass with a plain chart, featuring harmonic triads on the more conjunctive end.
Its form either
* Fixed melody mass (tenor mass), where an existing plain chant is used as-is as one track
* Paraphrase mass, where the plain chant was changed from being modal to more tonal. Josquin is master at this.
* Imitation mass, where any melody instead a of plain chant can do.

16th Century Catholic church was originally tolerant towards the last form of mass, until Martin Luther and the Reformation, his 95 theses targetting the church.
Council of Trent and the Counter Reformation lowered the tolerance for such, and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina's masses where the words are clearly distinguishable became acceptable to the church.

Palestrina may have been the most influential before Bach.
His mass features a clarity of words in that although multiple vocal parts involved, no syllables are started at the same time: when one starts, others are silent or maintaining a previous syllable.

### Madrigal

Madrigal of 16th Century put Italy at the center of western music development.

Madrigal is like a musical equivalent of written words, on the edge of developing into opera.

Typically secular, they are written for 4 - 6 distinct voices and not a choir, and also feature a clear and direct articulation of words.

Word painting can often be heard in Madrigals, e.g. "death", "descend" became literally descending notes, "live" lively notes, and "in pairs" in two vocals. 
As well as a combination of homophony and polyphony.

Poems of e.g. Petrarch (14th Century, founding Italian poet), are put into Madrigal.
Madrigals are composed in 16th and 17th Century in English as well, e.g. dedicated to Queen Elizabeth I.

### Baroque

The word originated from Portuguese meaning irregular shape / color of pearls.
Originally implying in bad taste, bizarre and overly extravagant, but the negative implication was lost over time.

1600 (when the first opera was performed in Florence) - 1750 (Bach died)

Opera features an expression of singularity: the emotion of the character as opposed to that of a (generalized) group.
(Think Dido's pain in Dido and Aeneas, vs that of Vesta in As Vesta was from Latmos hill descending.)

Music of this period features a duality of being exuberant yet tempered by control.
Its brilliance, logic, control, order and rationality behind the details (reflected by cyclical symmetry) is a mirror of the science and discovery of this age.

Think a Renaissance mass where it is tranquil, sober and seeks not to overwhelm us, vs Bach's mass featuring dance-like energy and exuberance, like an extravagant celebration concerted with voices and instruments.

French overture, especially during Louis XIV became a new trend, and Handel (Water Music) is a master at this.

Pure instrumental music without need for text or voice served as powerful enough statement, creating one of the most abstract form of art.

### Style features of Baroque music

Music in its raw definition, as time (rhythm) defined by sound (pitch, motifs, melodies, texture).
* A **pitch** is characterized by a **fundamental frequency** (e.g. an A at 440Hz) and **timbre** (tone color of the instrument. Other vibrations / overtones that differ instrument by instrument).
* A **note** is a pitch with duration. The succession of notes builds **melody**.
* A **motif** is a brief succession of notes, usually in groups of 3 to 6. A motif is constructed from repetition, sequence and transformation of notes.
* A **tune** is melody with lyricism (usually a clear begin and end), which can be not just for voice, but also conceptions.
* A **theme** can refer to a tune, motif, harmony, or even timbre that characterizes a piece.
* A **texture** refers to the number of melodies and their relationship.
  * The plain chant features **monophony**, one melodic line.
  * **Polyphony** (counterpoint) features multiple melody lines at the same time. Their relationship can be
    * Imitative, where the multiple melodies are similar repetitions of one. The **strict** variant meaning exact same, and **non-strict** being just similar. (This is called a **canon** in German, **round** in English, and its cyclical nature brings structure / conveys meaning)
    * Non-imitative, where the multiple melody lines are distinct. E.g. Josquin's 6 melodic lines with multiple poems being rendered at the same time
  * **Homophony**, where there are multiple melody lines but one is the principle one, while others are support / complementary to the thematic melody. E.g. Beethoven's 2nd movement Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor Op 13 Pathetique.

Through the manipulation of motifs (especially in sequence), baroque music achieves a consistency abd structure, which allowed abstract instrumental music to convey meaning.

It wasn't until the Baroque era that instrumental music became standalone (it used to exist, but as a piece to e.g. support dance).

The above concepts, through inquiry into music similar to the scientific inquiries of the same age, became interesting enough to inspire an instrumental music tradition starting from the Baroque era.

Beethoven's 5th is e.g. very motific: the first four notes being repeated and manipulated (upwards, downwards) gives an intensity and clearness of purpose.

Being motific is different from being tuneful.

Functional harmony (rest, tension, preparation), meter, tuning system, invention of instruments such as violin (and basso continuo e.g. cello, harpsichord) of the Baroque era all remain fundamental to western music till this day.

### German and Italian traditions

Broadly speaking, German and Italian tradition since the Baroque period was different.

Think early 19C Beethoven's 5th and his contemporary Rosini's Barber of Seville: the Italian tradition features opera with a usual focus on (light hearted, playful) entertainment, while the German / Austrian tradition is more profound and solemn.
In Rosini's words, Germans were better at harmony and Italians better at melody, until Mozart.

Music nationalism reflects not just differences in folk music elements, but also language, culture and ethnic mindset.

The Latin language features long, smooth vowels and gentle consonants, while the German language has many guttural, explosive and sharp consonants. (When it comes to melisma, you are as good as your vowels.)
The former is more melismatic, while the latter more syllabic (one pitch per syllable).

The Italian tradition inherits from Latin vocals, usually homophonic, has a preference for melodic directness.
This tradition gave birth to symphonies (evolved from overtures played for an opera) and concerto.

The German tradition is influenced by Protestant Reformation.
Luther who rejects the original sin, preaches faith alone is what matters, not prayers or connection to the church and that Bible is up for interpretation of each individual, was outraged by the Catholic church selling indulgence.

Luther was fond of modern music of his time, suggesting all music were a gift from God, leading to the creation of German hymns (Christ in all things).
The Protestant view lined up better with the ancient view of music as a spiritual force, and its music featuring clearly articulated rhythms, and sharp, compact, clear tunes.
Bach, under Lutheran influence, would not differentiate religious or secular music: all are acts of faith to honor God.
His German language and Lutheran faith would be the ground of his work.

### Bach's Fugue

Fugue is a form (procedure) that epitomizes Baroque systematic structure and extravagant ingenuity.

The harpsichord is often featured in fugue.

Fugues are polyphonic monothematic work (one subject dissected and reconstituted in multiple ways, along the process demonstrating the polyphonic capability of your subject.) 

The structure of a fugue is in 3 parts:
* Exposition, where voices (instrumental) of equal importance are introduced in sequence. As one enters, the currently ongoing ones carry on. It sounds like a round but is not a round or strictly imitative. The newly entering voice can only be the highest or lowest among current ones: soprano - alto - bass is not a valid sequence, while alto - soprano - bass is.
* Episode, this modulated section, usually several motifs, is used to transition into subject reconstruction. 
* Subject restatement which brings back the subject.

A good polyphonic work is seamless in the transition of the parts.

##### Tuning system

After Pythagoras's discovery of half length, an octave started out having 7 pitches in between.
The chromatic scale has 12 pitches in between.

Pythagorean scale (just intonation tuning) steps by the perfect 5th (each time we land on a different pitch), and maps onto 7 pitches in one octave. The tuned pitches match with the white keys on a piano.

Meantone temperament developed since the Renaissance introduced semi-tones, making the pitches in between 12. The extra 5 corresponds with black keys on the piano.

Modern tuning system does equal temperament tuning, this is different from Bach's well tempered tuning used in his well tempered clavier, two sets of Fugue and preludes in 24 major and minor keys.

### Opera

Renaissance period believed Greek drama were performed like opera: stage play set to music. And their people were moved by such drama because of such music: the power of music intensifies the words, adds musical inflection to the words, natural like kids at play.

There was also medieval musical liturgical drama at play during Christmas and Easter before this time, but the form differs much from opera.

Secular play was prevalent at the time, whose intermezzo (interlude between play) evolved to become full-fledged pieces, and opera is born.

The Florentine Camerata were a group of musicians and poets who pioneered this form, with their beliefs include
* a solo singer over a chorus offers more expressive flexibility, and the audience identifies personally with a solo singer better.
* Polyphony and wordplay are showing off and childish.
* Text must be clearly understood
* Text should be direct and natural as in daily life
* interpret te feelings and emotions of the singing ones, not literal meaning

Peri from this group composed Eurydice, set to stage in 1600, making it the first opera in record, with its unique style of representation and recitation.

Early opera soon matured, with Monteverdi's L'Orfeo performed 1607 in Manchua explored the same subject. (Story of Orpheus and Eurydice, with a culminating moment of Orpheus learning her being dead from a nymph.)

### Operadic Aria

Aria (air) differs from a song in the latter being simple, short, rhythmic, musical representation of text, while the operadic opera is typically lengthy, substantial, complicated and where the music, instead of words, carries the expressive message.

In an opera, two key elements, recitative is the dialogue, and aria is for expression of feelings, character development (where time stops and the character's inflection begins)

Aria is the focal point of Baroque opera, typically accompanied by orchestra, while recitative is performed dry, along basso continuo instruments.

### Cantata and Oratorio

The religious music tradition of the Baroque era diverged into Cantata for the Lutheran Church, and Oratorio for the Catholic Church.

The Lutheran Cantata is like a sermon set in music (harmonizing a carol), a one-act opera being part of service; and Oratorio like a multi-act religious opera with a concert but without acting.

The Catholic Lent might have given rise to Oratorio, during which time no opera is performed, and entertainment is instead found in opera-like Oratorio.
Hendel's Messiah (hallelujah) is an Oratorio still performed till this day.
Hendel was born in Germany, trained in Italy, started out in the Hannover court but spent most of his life composing in London.

Bach composed 350 Cantatas (the biggest chunk of his work) and more than 200 survived till this day.

### Baroque music forms

From a high level, forms are number of sections of music in a movement and how they relate: contrast, repetition, variation, development or combination.

Having familiar ways of organizing instrumental helps convey something this abstract to the audience, using something they have prior knowledge of. (imagine a police TV show)
The Baroque era typically features great discipline and logic in organization.

Although the structures (the shared context) are categorized into familiar sets, e.g. fugue and passacaglia, the details within each piece can differ greatly.

Fantasia and impromptu are not following an established forms.

Baroque era variation forms first states a theme, and then play variations of it.
Passacaglia (ground base: a structural feature) is of this category, which features a strict cyclic repetition of the theme with a development in the upper voices.

An example being Bach's Passacaglia in C Minor.

**Chamber music** is where each instrument has its own part of the music to play. E.g. a string quartet where the 2 violins, 1 viola and 1 cello are playing different parts.

**Orchestral music** is where one or more parts are at least doubled in instruments: in a modern orchestra, the 16-18 first violins all play one part, 16 second violins all play one part, 12 violas, 10 cellos etc.

**Chamber-Orchestral** is where each part is still played by 1 instrument, but with a variety of instruments like in an orchestra: 1 first violin, 1 second, 1 bass, 1 flute, 1 oboe, 1 french horn, etc.

The Orchestra came from Opera House Orchestra, and the operadic practices saw the development of Italian style overture (which morphed into symphonies), the French overture, the orchestral suite (collection of dances for an orchestra) and concerto.

The term Orchestra derived from in Greek plays the space between the stage and the rows of audience.

The **concerto** usually features few soloists and an orchestra. E.g. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto.

They are categorized as **solo** where one soloist is pitched against an orchestra, **grosso** (grand, where there are 2, 3, or 4 soloists).
(Concertino - the group of soloists Ripieno; Ripieno - the ensemble of accompanying orchestra; Tutti - all)

Note this being from Baroque era, is different from a symphony, which is a classical era concept.

Concertos are typically 3 movements, fast, slow and fast.
Fast movement often features the Ritornello form: departure and return from a theme. Homophonic thematic statement with polyphonic concertino.
Then a slow adagio, and then a fast and fugue-like (polyphonic in nature, with theme dissected and recombined) 3rd movement.

Vivaldi from the high Baroque taught Bach concerti, and the latter wrote e.g. 6 Branden concerti as a job application.
Bach's music was not considered great of his age: criticized for being overly complicated and hard-to-play.

### Enlightenment and classical

1750 - 1827 (death of Bach to death of Beethoven), but the exact dates are fuzzy.

There is, however, a big contrast between early 18 Century and late 18 Century work, in terms of
* Instrument: piano was invented and popularized in the classical era. Driven by the need for a portable harpsichord that follows the dynamics of human voice. The first piano was named by its (harpsichord) manufacturer as a big harpsichord with soft and loud sounds. The difference between a harpsichord and piano is that the strings of the former are plucked, while the latter is struck by a hammer, thus achieving graded dynamics, un-uniform volume that responds to how hard the key is pressed. This makes the piano better suited for a homophonic texture and mimic'ing a more intimate human voice. (Dynamic grading in harpsichord can only be achieved with multiple sets of strings.)
* Texture. Rise of an instrument that is well suited for homophonic texture.
* Expression. Different tunes.
* Thematic melody. This is subjective, but the classical era typically contrives to show a different thing: not the exuberance and complexity, but rather a human-voice-like subtle, intimate and natural impression.

The time period of classical era sees the focus shift from a land-owning inheritance-based aristocracy to a middle class flourishing on trade and manufacturing with a love of wealth.

This rising middle class demands education, control of their own lives, quality of life and social mobility.

In music, this new class seeks accessibility and expressiveness of the human voice, and not the high Baroque complexity on the surface or exuberance. "Natural" is the buzzword of enlightenment era.

Music would become vocal and tuneful, and tunes clear and engaging.

Rise of amateurism also demands pieces that an amateur would want to and be able to play: Bach's fugues are too complicated.
Although content-wise, Mozart's no simpler, but the expressive style and appearance of simplicity by design captures the classical era audience's taste better.

Cosmopolitanism is another feature of classical era: pan-European and a fusion of Italian/German/French styles.

Ultimately, the cultural environment defines the sound.

### Viennese classical style, homophony and cadence

Classical era music features melodic beauty and clarity above all else: balance of purity of the form, and expressive constraints.

While Bach's fugue would feature little dynamics (in volume), strong beats (pulse), and less flexibility, often a cyclical structure, Mozart's piano sonata would feature simple and direct melodies and a linear structure.

As another example from Baroque, Pachelbel's Canon (which was a passacaglia, not a canon per se) features 28 repetition of its ground base.
If we are to shuffle, rearrange and cut this piece, the dramatic expression would work just fine, it's often times difficult to tell even when the piece is about to finish.
This has to do with the Baroque era's usually monothematic themes, its focus on rhythmic continuity and cyclical process.

Classical era would instead emphasize development and discontinuity, e.g. this era saw the cadential flourish, where **cadence** means the end of a phrase (in music, a formula that conveys conclusion; a musical punctuation mark, which was rarely seen in Baroque era)

Classical era saw the development of 4 styles of cadence:
* Open cadence, where tonic (tonal center, major scale) chord transitions to dominant (tension) chord (a perfect fifth away from the tonic pitch). This is build tension via dissonance, and create irresolution.
* Closed (authentic) cadence, where the dominant chord resolves to tonic chord, creating a musical period.
* False cadence, where the dominant chord resolves to not the tonic chord, creating a delay.
* Plagal (amen) cadence, where the subdominant chord resolves to the tonic chord.

Classical era cadences are cause for pause and rhetorical elements, and they allow composers to end one section and start another within a single movement.
Cadence exist in Baroque music, but they were not cause for pause, given the latter's focus on musical continuity.

Vienna in 1770 to 1800 under the enlightened rule of Joseph II became the center of this development, with the city being the adopted home of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven.

### Classical era form: theme and variations

Classical era forms derive from the Baroque era, from simple to complex
* Theme and variations derive from passacaglia, with the difference being the latter having the theme played as a base in repetition, and the former putting the theme as the surface element.
* Minuet and trio
* Rondo deriving from ritornello form
* Sonata deriving from binary dance form

The form defines thematic relationship between sections (where sections are divided by cadences).
With the relationship being
* Repetition (a), denoted with the repetition sign.
* Variation (a'), where the same thematic material is repeated but with different accompaniment.
* Contrast (b), where a different same thematic material is applied. There are different degrees of contrast, slight/bold.

Theme and variations form follow the same phrase structure.
E.g. Mozart's 12 variation on Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (Ah vous dirai-je, maman) features the same aababa structure, where theme is in major, duple (notes in twos), moderate tempo, and the variations can change in accompaniment, notes in threes, tempo, minor mode, etc.

A **coda** (tail) is an expanded rhetorical final cadence flourish to conclude the piece.

Consequently, theme and variations form
* feels sectional due to close cadences
* is usually not dramatic
* relation between sections is variation and little departure

### Classical era form - minuet and trio - Baroque antecedents

Of the Classical era homophonic forms, minuet and trio derives from stylized French dance suites from opera in the high Baroque.

Minuet and trio is so ubiquitous that usually a four-movement classical piece, such as a symphony, would have one movement in this form.

Dance suites meaning excerpts from an opera piece, stylized for listening rather than dancing to.
The real piece is usually short and formulaic, and the stylized version longer and more interesting for listening.
Such pieces in Baroque era was also homophonic in nature: a polyphonic texture would cause mayhem in choreography otherwise.

Minuet by itself is a Baroque French dance style, and there are many others such as Allemande, Bourrée, etc, with many derived from other places in Europe.

This antecedent was almost always of binary dance form: sections AABB.

Trio Sonata is a Baroque chamber music form, with two sopranos (violins) + one base (cello) + one basso continuo (harpsichord).
Named trio since the basso continuo is by default present. Change that to viola and we get classical era string quartet.

Lully was the court music master of Louis XIV, under whose reign the French noble dances flourished.
A Trio Sonata could e.g. be of the general structure ABA, with each section in compound duple (123 223), and the first A (first minuet) into aabb, the second minuet (trio) ccdd, and a thematic closure / menuet da capo of sections ab, where we return to the opening section.

This form features thematic contrast within a movement, adding flavor to relation between sections.
