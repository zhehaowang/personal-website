# Atomic Habits

The 1% marginal gains.
* Effect of time. Compounding.
* Small changes appear to make no difference, until the critical mass. We often times fail to realize the effects of the small changes, until they build up over time, for good or bad.

Your goal and your system.
* Goals are snapshots. Fix the snapshot, over time you may relapse.
* Goals hurt your happiness. After achieving something we can be happy.
* Goals are binary.
* System allows you to continue playing the game, not finishing the game.

You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your habits.

Small and easy habits as compound interest of self improvement: systematic improvement.

Good habits are hard to keep.
Unhealthy habits tend to be hard to break.

Are we changing the wrong thing?

Three levels of change: outcome, process, identity.
Focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you want to become.
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become.
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs and to upgrade and expand your identity.
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

Is this what a healthy / productive person would do?
Goal is not to read a book but to embrace the identity of a learned person, not to lose 30 pounds but to become a healthy person.

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to be automatic.
The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems in life with as little efforts and energy as possible.

Habit can be broke down into a feedback loop with four steps, cue, craving, response, and reward.
Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying.

### Make it obvious

Identify your habits. Habit scorecard. Those that you do so much that they become automatic and escapes your notice.
What is lined up with who you want to become, and what is not?

When starting a new habit, specify time and location.
Implementation intention. Be specific. Don't be vague, like eating healthier.
Habit stacking: pair a new habit with a current habit.

##### Motivation is overrated. Environment matters more

Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.
Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
Make cues to a good habit obvious in your environment.
Easier to build new habits in new environment because you are not fighting old cues.

##### Secret to self control

Make the environment / cues that induce bad habits invisible.
People with high self control tend to spend less time in tempting situations.
It's easier to avoid temptations than to resist them.
One of the practical ways to eliminate bad habits is to reduce the exposure to the cue that causes it.
Self control is short term strategy, not long one.

### Make it attractive

We've gotten better at pushing our buttons, junk food, video games, porn, etc.

The more attractive something is, the more likely it becomes a habit.
Habits are dopamine driven feedback loops, when dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
It is the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment, that gets us to get action.
Temptation bundling is one strategy to make something more attractive. Pair something you want to do with something you need to do.

##### The role of family and friends

The culture we live in determines what habits are praised and approved.
We tend to adopt those habits because of our strong desire to fit in.
We tend to imitate three groups, the close, the many and the powerful.
Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior, and you already have something in common with the group.
If a behavior will get approval and praise, we'll likely find it attractive.

##### Finding and fixing your bad habits

Make bad habits unattractive.
Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper motive.
Your habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires. The cause of your habits is the prediction that precedes them.
Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
