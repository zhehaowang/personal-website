# Bloomberg 2017 - 2018

11/23/2018


The coming week marks the end to my first job as a full-time software engineer, working with Bloomberg LP.

In the last year and a half I was gifted with the opportunity to work in an incredible environment with many talented people, for which I remain forever grateful.
I was fortunate enough to have forged a bond with a few among them, hopefully one that will last beyond my now limited days in the company.

### The decision

Before transitioning from a student researcher to a professional engineer, I did not picture myself looking for new opportunities, or quitting a job in the first two years.

I knew there would be problems, and things that I dislike, but as engineers we are hired to deal with them, and in doing so we develop our core skill set, namely that of problem solving.

It would probably sound hypocritical that I claim I still hold such beliefs, despite being a leaver in the first two years.
However, there is often times a plethora of other factors behind a decision, and I hope to justify mine from these ones below.

##### Growth

As a junior engineer growing my skill set is the topmost concern.

There is a tactician and a strategist in everyone of us, the tactician seeks the best approach to our battles at hand, and throws our entire personality at them, while the strategist looks ahead and behind, carefully planning the next campaign, making sure it's fought at the right time and place so that we could reap the heftiest benefits.

As the strategist surveys the battleground, he is not optimistic about the outlooks.

In seeking growth we strive for the areas we want to grow in to line up with our efforts at work.
Yet most of the time we find the work highly specialized in particular and minute areas, that we doubt if anything we gain is of strategic value, or could count as transferrable skills.

If we couple that with legacy frameworks inherited from a long past (by software engineering standards), the outlook dims further.
Legacy systems aren't necessarily evil, and everything has its lifetime.
Plus we were taught to be skeptical about the new and shiny technologies, and to focus on grasping the fundamentals.
But add debt atop the legacy: questionable design decisions from ten years ago, friction in being able to effectively develop and iterate, and the issue becomes worse.

Now this may make a great proving ground for a skilled veteran, and I'd be far too delusional to consider count myself among such.

It's comforting that the company is actively looking to address many of these, but it also takes time to overcome the inertia.

##### Embracing change

Being curious is mentioned as a highly desirable trait in software engineers by many sources.

Seeing the woes of our development today, sometimes I can't help but wonder how others do it differently.
And what could be better than to experience them firsthand?
Without seeing a contrast, it's even difficult to appreciate what we enjoy here.

Over the year I saw myself becoming accustomed to bad practices, and getting satisfied from just getting by.
And come to think of it, this would be the exact state we fear: settle for the sub-optimal, for knowing only the superficial, or becoming stale.
The environment, it assimilates us: it lures us to its comforts, dulls our senses and weakens our resolve.

I am aware the young are often criticized for their lack of perseverance in pursuing one thing for a prolonged period of time.
I myself may very well be subject to this blame.
Yet the other side of it is that we live but once the twenty-fifth year of our lives, perhaps the best period to expand our horizons and embrace change.

### What I learnt

* C++
* Financial market
* Woes in software architecture
* Soft skills

### Going forward

It pains to state that from my down-sampled observation, quite a few who left are considered the best and brightest among us.
I mean no offense to those who stayed: I admire your dedication and loyalty.
Nor dare I number myself among their ranks.

Now that we are given a similar opportunity to start fresh at a place well regarded by many, I hope we make sure to treasure such.

* Proactivity
* Deliver
* Critical path and prioritization
* Advocate for yourself, sell, and speaking up
