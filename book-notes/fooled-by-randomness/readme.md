# Fooled by randomness

Thoughts on fallibility of human knowledge by a former options trader.

### Part I

**Luck is often mistaken for skills, probability mistaken for certainty.**

Croesus wanted to impress Solon with his fortune, and asked Solon who the happiest man is.
Solon suggested one who lived a noble life and died for their duties. Reason being.

"You asked me a question concerning a condition of humankind â€” happiness. I reckon 70 years to be a long life. Of those 26,250 days, no two will be the same. We are wholly accident. Good fortune is always mixed with misery. In the journey of our lives there is an infinity of twists and turns, and the weather can change from calm to whirlwind in an instant. We can never know what might come next. The gods are jealous and like to mess with mortals. Sometimes we get a glimpse of happiness, and then are plunged into ruin. Yes you are fortunate, wonderfully rich, lord of many peoples. But with respect to the question you asked, I have no answer, until I hear that you have closed your life happily."

Monte carlo, random process, alternate history. "Why me"?

It is not natural for us to learn from history.

Hindsight bias.

**Over a short time increment, one observes the variability of the portfolio, not the returns.**

A trader making money does not mean he is good.
Similarly, passing a particular interview does not mean you are good.

**Don't get your causality reversed.**
Our emotions may not be designed to understand such.

Ultimately news / media is an entertainment industry.

**We often mistake probability for expectation**: high chance of market going up does not mean you should long, if in the rare case of it going down, it's going down by a lot.

This asymmetry / skewness is often times counterintuitive, considering that we are used to symmetric bell curves in everyday lives.

Consider this, is market statistics even _stationary_ (as we observe, the distribution itself may shift).

If the distribution is not stationary, can past data even be used to forecast future performance, if so, to what extent?

Consider this statement: "I have just completed a thorough statistical analysis of the life of president Bush. For fifty-eight years, close to 21000 observations, he did not die once. I can hence pronounce him as immortal, with a high degree of statisical significance."

Rare events do happen.
**If the past, by bringing surprises, did not resemble the past previous to it, then why should our future resemble our current past?**

Extreme empiricism, competitiveness, and an absence of logical structure to one's inference can be quite a explosive combination.

A scientific hypothesis is falsifiable. Newton's Laws are science, and falsified; astrology is not, as it's not falsifiable.

Karl Popper would claim **there are only two types of theories, those that are known to be wrong (falsified), and those that have yet been known to be wrong.**

### Part II

Survivorship bias.

Ergodicity, roughly, under certain conditions very long sample paths would end up resembling each other.

**Remember that nobody accepts randomness in his own success, only his failure.**

There is a high probability of the investment coming to you if its success is caused entirely by randomness. (Say, an actively managed fund with an outstanding track record due to pure randomness.)

Is it really a small world?
The world is much larger than we think, it is just that we are not truly testing for the odds of having an encounter with one specific person in a specific location at a specific time. Rather, we are simply testing for any encounter, with any person we have ever met in the past, and in any place we will visit during the period concerned.
(Think birthday paradox: get 23 persons in a room there is about 50% chance of two having the same birthday. Seems large, no? Remember we are testing for "any" pairs.)

Consider backtesting particular strategies on historical data: you might be fitting the rule on the data, and **the more you try, the more likely, by mere luck, you'll be able to find a rule that worked on past data**: e.g. correlating stock markets with length of women's skirts, or finding that one instrument whose movement is perfectly correlated with weather in Ulan Bator.

You might be throwing monkeys at typewriters, not telling them what book to write! (If you throw enough monkeys, one of them will produce Illiad. But how likely is he to then produce Odyssey?)

Stock analysts have both a worse record and higher idea of their past performance than weather forecasters.

The sample size matters!

Our emotional apparatus is designed for linear causality, for instance you study everyday and learn something proportional to your studies. If you don't go anywhere, you will be demoralized.

But **the reality rarely gives us the satisfaction of a linear positive progression**, you may study for a year and learn nothing, then, unless you are disheartened and give up, something will come to you in a flash.
This summarizes why there are routes to success that are nonrandom, but few, very few, people have the mental stamina to follow them.

**Those who go the extra mile are rewarded. Most people give up before the rewards.**

An example of biases in understanding probabilities: a test of disease has 5% false positive, the disease strikes 0.1% of the population. We test people at random and someone turns out positive. What's the probability of someone actually having the disease? By Bayesian formula, it's about 2%. Usually smaller than our estimates.

On Bloomberg: "it acts as a safe email service, a news service, a historical data retrieving tool, a charting system, an invalubable analytical aid, and a screen where I can see the price of securities and currencies. I have gotten so addicted to it that I cannot operate without it, as I would otherwise feel cut off from the rest of the world. I use it to get in contact with my friends, confirm appointments, and solve some of those entertaining quarrels that put some sharpness into life. Somehow, traders who do not have a Bloomberg address do not exist for us."

### Part III

**Wittgenstein's Ruler: when a criteria (such as our opinions of something, or a book review) speaks more about the criteria itself, rather than the subject being reviewed.**

Randomness and personal elegance.

**Flexibility around a schedule and happiness.**
