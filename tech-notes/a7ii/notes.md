# Controls in A7 II

### Camera modes

* Auto
* Program mode (P). Auto.
* Aperture Priority (A). Front dial controls aperture (camera controls shutter, iso)
  * Analogous to pupil.
  * Measured by. f/x, the smaller x, the bigger aperture (more light is let in), the more background blur (see depth-of-field). (e.g. f/1.8 - f/22). f/2.8 lets in 4 times as much light as f/5.6. Typically each f stop steps are arranged by a factor of `sqrt(2)`, meaning each step brings in double the amount of light, and your shutter speed can get cut by half, while iso remains unchanged to get the same exposure. A f/3.5-f/5.6 on a zoom lens says at minimum / maximum focal lengths, what the lowest f stop numbers are.
  * Userful for controlling background blur. (as a lower f stop number gives you shallower DoF)
* Shutter Priority (S). Front dial controls shutter (camera controls aperture, iso)
  * How long the shutter is open for. You can shoot in smallest shutter period possible, in which case camera will likely dial up iso, resulting in noises. To capture fast moving objects you generally want faster shutter speed.
  * Measured by seconds. E.g. 1/60s.
  * Useful for capturing movement.
* Manual mode (M). Front dial controls aperture. Back dial controls shutter speed. (camera controls iso)
  * Can switch to bulb mode, where shutter can open for more than 30s by holding. (E.g. night sky)
  * When you need to control background blur and freeze movement.
* Video mode.

### Drive mode (shutter mode)

* Single shooting
* Continuous shooting
* Self timer setting

### Bracketing (HDR)

* E.g. 2ev 3img, takes 3 pictures at -2, 0, +2 (controls exposure, brighter or darker)
* Useful for HDR (high dynamic range), where you blend different exposures and take the best of each
* This camera has HDR built-in, but it may not do a good job

### Exposure compensation

* Exposure dial: decides the exposure (e.g. +2ev). Shift the light (exposure) histogram horizontally.

### Focusing mode

* Single-shot auto focus (AFS): once you focus (hold shoot half down), lock in focus even if you move the camera. Allows focus recompose (most cameras auto focus best the centered object, you could use AF on that, then shift the camera so that the subject is in the thirds. Watch out if you have a very shallow DoF. You will be rotating the camera so with a shallow DoF this may cause your subject to be out of focus).
* Continuous auto focus (AFC): as the subject moves, refocus continuously. Not especially reliable. Can use for action. A lower f stop lens also makes it faster to autofocus moving subjects.
* Dynamic manual focus (DMF): auto focus by default, but you can also grab the focus ring (lens) and focus manually.
* Manual focus (MF): disable auto focus. Disable auto focus. Does nothing when shoot half down.

Cameras autofocus by focusing farther and closer until they find maximum contrast.
If you are attempting to focus on a solid color, the autofocus system won't be able to find any contrast, regardless of the amount of light you have.

### Focus area

* Wide: camera picks focus point for you
* Flexible spot: always focus on the area you choose
  * The smaller focus area, the easier to pin point something especially with a shallow depth of field, the longer the focus time
* Continuous focus
* Zone focus: e.g. left third
* Center focus

### Manual focus

* Mirrorless has these features making manual focus more practical. On DSLRs, manual focus using a small viewfinder is less practical than autofocus, manual focusing and zooming in with live view takes time.
  * Manual focus assist: when Manual Focus is on, grabbing focus ring zooms in in monitor
  * Focus peaking: colors what's in focus

### Adapting lenses

* APS-C size capture, auto lets the camera decides if the attached lens is APS-C, otherwise force full-frame
* Steady shots, if you attach a non-Sony lens, may need to set steady shots focal lens to manual to match your lens.

### Metering modes

Decides how the camera should auto adjust iso, etc
* Multi: default. Usually intelligent.
* Center
* Spot

### ISO

Sensitivty of your sensor. Given a certain shutter speed and aperture, low iso gives dark image, high iso gives bright image.
* Auto
* Manual, 12800, ..., 100, 50; higher iso has higher noise

### White balance

* Auto, cloudy, shade, daylight, etc. Doesn't matter when you shoot raw.

### Diopter

* Next to EVF, for glasses users looking through EVF.

### Shooting raw

* You can shoot raw or jpeg
* Choose in quality: raw, fine, jpeg, raw & jpeg
* Picasa, or Lightroom can work with raw

### Other settings

* Customize keys, customize
  * control wheel
  * buttons C1, C2, etc
  * which button focuses (back-button focus e.g.)
* Audio signals off (no focusing beeps)

### Tripods

# Concepts

### Depth of field

The range of distance in an image where the focus is acceptably sharp.
Lens focal length, aperture, and distance to your subject decides DoF.

* Short lens focal length: deep DoF, wide field of view, objects appear farther away from your subject. Long lens focal length: shallow DoF, narrow field of view, objects appear closer to your subject
* Aperture: the wider the aperture (lower f stop number), the shallower DoF
* Distance to subject: the closer you are to your subject, the shallower DoF
* Sensor sizes: the larger the sensor, the shallower DoF (a 100mm f/2.8 lens on a cropped sensor by crop factor 2 generates the same perspective and DoF as a 200mm f/5.6 lens on a full frame lens)

DoF can be used to
* isolate your subject from other elements in a photo (e.g. portrait background blur),
* foreground blur, remove obstacles (e.g. fences),
* give better bokeh (visual quality of out-of-focus parts of an image: e.g. smooth circular light spots from an out-of-focus background)

### Histogram

Color distribution on the spectrum of shadow - light. In general, try avoiding spikes.

### Noise

### Lenses, landscape photography

Our eyes are used to seeing the world at around 50mm focal length, phone cameras capture images around 30mm.
To go below that with a short focal length wide-angle or a telephoto focal length can often reflect the world in ways our eyes were not used to seeing.
Wide-angle lens may make it harder to compose the image, a lot will be in your field of view, and you have a larger depth of field.
With a telephoto lens you are going to remove a lot of the context, e.g. creating an abstract image. Telephoto lens also pull distant things together.

Similarly, we are used to seeing the world 1.2m to 1.7m above the ground. When you get the camera lower or higher than that, it could also reflect the world in ways our eyes were not used to seeing.

If you are out and don't have the lens of the desired focal length with you, think differently and compose differently, move around, experiment.

### Misc

* In landscape photography, travel as light as possible: anything that dissuades you from moving is going to hurt, and your creativity / focus will be restricted if you are out of breath.

### Sharpness

### Mirrorless vs DSLR

Size, electronic / optical view finder, focus time, battery life, etc

### Tripod

* Head (pan \& zoom (two degree-of-freedom), three lever, ball head)
* Feet (replaceable, e.g. nails)
* Legs (flipped, twisted)
* Material (aluminum, carbon fiber)
* Center column (gets wobbly, raise it only you need to)

Look for one tall enough
