Fed
* serves as a lender of last resort to maintain financial stability in the system.
* controls money supply.

Reserve ratio: the fraction of total deposits that a bank holds as reserves.
The Fed sets a minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold, called a reserve requirement.
* if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply of money.
* when banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, the banking system creates money (it does not create any wealth).

Money multiplier (how much money does each dollar of reserve generates) is the inverse of reserve ratio. (E.g. if total deposit is 100, reserve ratio is 50%, then first bank can loan out 50 to second bank, creating 50 in money, second bank can loan out half to that to third, creating 25 in money, and the total amount of money in circulation is 200.)

A bank's balance sheet might look like
* Asset: reserves, loans made, and securities bought.
* Liability: deposits, debts, and capital (owner's equity)
The two are balanced by definition, because owner's equity is whatever the imbalance ends up being.
When capital goes negative, the bank becomes insolvent: it's unable to pay its debts.

The leverage ratio of a bank is its total asset to bank capital. (Capital comes from owners, everything else in liability is loaned, so total liability / capital is its leverage ratio.)

Bank regulators require banks to hold a certain amount of capital. The goal of such a capital requirement is to ensure that banks will be able to pay off their depositors (without having to resort to government-provided deposit insurance funds)


* Fed's control of money supply
  * influences the quantity of reserves
    * Open-market operation: the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds.
      * If the FOMC decides to increase the money supply, the Fed creates dollars and uses them to buy government bonds from the public in the nation's bond markets.
      * Conversely, if the FOMC decides to decrease the money supply, the Fed sells government bonds from its portfolio to the public in the nationâ€™s bond markets. After the sale, the dollars the Fed receives for the bonds are out of the hands of the public.
    * Lending to banks
      * Fed lends to banks at a rate called discount rate: increasing it discourages banks from borrowing from the Fed, which brings down their reserves and reduces money supply.
  * influence reserve ratio
    * Change reserve requirement. Rare because it is disruptive and many banks hold excess reserves.
    * Paying interest on reserves. Since 2008, Fed started paying interest to banks reserve with the Fed. Increasing this rate incentivizes banks to increase reserve ratio.

The Fed's various tools are not precise: it needs some estimate of household deposits, and some estimate of banks' real reserve ratio.

* Fed funds rate: short term interest rate banks can charge one another for loans. (one bank with excess reserves lends to another short on reserves. Typically overnight, and priced at fed funds rate).
  * In practice this rate moves closely with discount rate.
  * Interest rates on different kinds of loans are strongly correlated with one another, and other interest rates often move in the same direction as this rate.
  * FOMC meeting sets a target fed fund rate, and let supply/demand hit the Fed fund rates it targetted. Supply/demand is controlled by Fed operation. E.g. when it buys national debt, fewer banks need to borrow to meet reserve requirement, and Fed fund rate drops.
  * When the Fed announces a change in the federal funds rate, it is committing itself to the open-market operations necessary to make that change happen, and these open-market operations will alter the supply of money.
