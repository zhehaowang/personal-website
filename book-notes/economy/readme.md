# Money and prices in the long run

Wealth

Money
* Medium of transaction
* Unit of account
* Store of value

Kinds of money
* Intrinsic money (gold, cigarettes in prison camps)
* Fiat money (paper money)

* currency, checking account, saving account, money mutual funds


Fed
* serves as a lender of last resort to maintain financial stability in the system.
* controls money supply.

Reserve ratio: the fraction of total deposits that a bank holds as reserves.
The Fed sets a minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold, called a reserve requirement.
* if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply of money.
* when banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, the banking system creates money (it does not create any wealth).

Money multiplier (how much money does each dollar of reserve generates) is the inverse of reserve ratio. (E.g. if total deposit is 100, reserve ratio is 50%, then first bank can loan out 50 to second bank, creating 50 in money, second bank can loan out half to that to third, creating 25 in money, and the total amount of money in circulation is 200.)

A bank's balance sheet might look like
* Asset: reserves, loans made, and securities bought.
* Liability: deposits, debts, and capital (owner's equity)
The two are balanced by definition, because owner's equity is whatever the imbalance ends up being.
When capital goes negative, the bank becomes insolvent: it's unable to pay its debts.

The leverage ratio of a bank is its total asset to bank capital. (Capital comes from owners, everything else in liability is loaned, so total liability / capital is its leverage ratio.)

Bank regulators require banks to hold a certain amount of capital. The goal of such a capital requirement is to ensure that banks will be able to pay off their depositors (without having to resort to government-provided deposit insurance funds)


* Fed's control of money supply
  * influences the quantity of reserves
    * Open-market operation: the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds.
      * If the FOMC decides to increase the money supply, the Fed creates dollars and uses them to buy government bonds from the public in the nation's bond markets.
      * Conversely, if the FOMC decides to decrease the money supply, the Fed sells government bonds from its portfolio to the public in the nation’s bond markets. After the sale, the dollars the Fed receives for the bonds are out of the hands of the public.
    * Lending to banks
      * Fed lends to banks at a rate called discount rate: increasing it discourages banks from borrowing from the Fed, which brings down their reserves and reduces money supply.
  * influence reserve ratio
    * Change reserve requirement. Rare because it is disruptive and many banks hold excess reserves.
    * Paying interest on reserves. Since 2008, Fed started paying interest to banks reserve with the Fed. Increasing this rate incentivizes banks to increase reserve ratio.

The Fed's various tools are not precise: it needs some estimate of household deposits, and some estimate of banks' real reserve ratio.

* Fed funds rate: short term interest rate banks can charge one another for loans. (one bank with excess reserves lends to another short on reserves. Typically overnight, and priced at fed funds rate).
  * In practice this rate moves closely with discount rate.
  * Interest rates on different kinds of loans are strongly correlated with one another, and other interest rates often move in the same direction as this rate.
  * FOMC meeting sets a target fed fund rate, and let supply/demand hit the Fed fund rates it targetted. Supply/demand is controlled by Fed operation. E.g. when it buys national debt, fewer banks need to borrow to meet reserve requirement, and Fed fund rate drops.
  * When the Fed announces a change in the federal funds rate, it is committing itself to the open-market operations necessary to make that change happen, and these open-market operations will alter the supply of money.


### The demand for money

Reflects how much wealth people want to hold in liquid form.

The quantity of money demanded depends on the interest rate that a person could earn by using the money to buy an interest bearing bond rather than leaving it in his wallet or low-interest checking account.

A higher price level (a lower value of money) increases the quantity of money demanded.

**quantity theory of money** asserts that the quantity of money available determines
the price level and that the growth rate in the quantity of money available determines the inflation rate.

### Classical dichotomy

* nominal variables — variables measured in monetary units.
* real variables — variables measured in physical units.
* monetary neutrality - the proposition that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables

Monetary neutrality is unrealistic, especially in the short run -- the change in metric leads to confusions and mistakes, but less so in the long run.

### velocity of money

the rate at which money changes hands

quantity equation:

```
MoneySuppy * VelocityOfMoney = PriceOfOutput * AmountOfOutput
```
So when `MoneySupply` goes up, `Velocity` must go down or rhs must go up.

`Velocity` had been relatively stable throughout time.

If inflation is so easy to explain, why do the central banks of these countries choose to print so much money that its value is certain to fall rapidly over time?

The governments of these countries are using money creation as a way to pay for their spending.
Usually government spending is paid for by levying taxes, but it could also be paid for by printing money, somewhat like an **inflation tax**, like a tax on everyone who holds money.

When the government has high spending, inadequate tax revenue, and limited ability to borrow, it turns to the printing press to pay for its spending. The inflation ends when the government institutes fiscal reforms -- such as cuts in government spending -- that eliminate the need for the inflation tax.

### The Fisher effect
```
Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate
```
* the supply and demand for loanable funds determine the real interest rate.
* growth in the money supply determines the inflation rate.

Money neutrality in the long run suggests real interest rate is not affected by money supply, so when the Fed increases the rate of money growth, the long-run result is both a higher inflation rate and a higher nominal interest rate.

This adjustment of nominal interest rate to (expected) inflation rate is called the **Fisher effect**.

### Is inflation bad

Does it reduce people's purchasing power?
You pay more for what you buy, but most people as sellers of labor / services, also receive more for what they sell -- inflation does not in itself reduce people's real purchasing power.

But, persistent growth in money supply does have some adverse effects on real variables.
* inflation tax gives people an incentive to avoid paying this tax. (shoeleather cost: inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings)
* Menu costs (change of value of money -- decide the new price -- print the new menu -- cost)
* Misallocation of resources -- when inflation distorts relative prices, consumer decisions are distorted and markets are less able to allocate resources to their best use.
* Almost all taxes distort incentives, cause people to alter their behavior, and lead to a less efficient allocation of the economy's resources. Many taxes become even more problematic in the presence of inflation. (inflation tends to raise the tax burden on income earned from savings, e.g. inflation exaggerates the size of capital gains and inadvertently increases the tax burden on this type of income; or interest tax tax'ed on nominal interest rate).
  * Higher inflation tends to discourage people from saving (_that is, even after nominal interest rate catches up to inflation rate_).
  * In an ideal world, the tax laws would be written so that inflation would not alter anyone's real tax liability.
* Confusion and inconvenience.

Also, unexpected changes in prices redistribute wealth among debtors and creditors.
If inflation were predictable, then debtors and creditors could take inflation into account when setting the nominal interest rate (Fisher effect), but if inflation is hard to predict, it imposes risk on debtors and creditors that both would prefer to avoid.

There are no known examples of economies with high, stable inflation.
If a country pursues a high-inflation monetary policy, it will have to bear not only the costs of high expected inflation but also the arbitrary redistributions of wealth associated with unexpected inflation.

Deflation may be worse (e.g. when it comes as a surprise, it often results in the redistribution of wealth toward creditors and away from debtors. Because debtors are often poorer, these redistributions in wealth are particularly painful).
Also, deflation is often a symptom of deeper economic problems.

# Open economy, international trade

```
Net exports = Value of country's exports - Value of country's imports
Net capital outflow = Purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents - Purchase of domestic assets by foreigners.
```
When net capital outflow is postive, capital is flowing out of the country (e.g. residents buying foreign stocks, restaurant chain opening oversees branches)

```
Net exports = Net capital outflow
```
(when a domestic resident exports, they get paid in foreign currency -- acquiring foreign assets.)

When a nation is running a trade surplus, the foreign currency it acquires is used to buy foreign assets (capital is flowing out of the nation)

Components of a country's GDP (total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services)
```
GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Purchases + Net Exports
National Saving = Domestic Investment + Net Capital Outflow
```
(for each dollar of saving, it's either invested in domestic or foreign assets)

**Is trade deficit a national problem?**

Imagine trade deficit induced by a drop in national saving (e.g. US in the 1980s, when Reagan cut taxes, increased spending and enlarged government deficit), then it's better to have trade deficit / foreign investment, then having to drop domestic investment.

Now imagine trade deficit induced by investment boom like in the 90s, the economy is borrowing from abroad to fund its growth. The additional capital helps if the investment projects yielded good results.

Just as an individual can go into debt in either a prudent or a profligate manner, so can a nation. A trade deficit is not a problem in itself, but it can sometimes be a symptom of a problem

### Prices for international transactions

* **nominal exchange rate**: the rate at which a person can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another.
* **real exchange rate**: the rate at which a person can trade the goods and services of one country for the goods and services of another.
```
Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate * Domestic Price / Foreign Price
```
(Domestic Price, or Domestic Consumer Price Index)

Real exchange rate is a key determinant in how much a country exports / imports.

### Exchange rate determination

One theory of exchange rates, **purchasing-power parity**: a unit of any given currency should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all countries.

Parity means equality, and purchasing power refers to the value of money in terms of the quantity of goods it can buy. Purchasing-power parity states that a unit of a currency must have the same real value in every country. ($1 in the US and Japan gets the same amount of coffee.)

The assumption is no arbitrage. If there is disparity, arbitrage would happen to drag it back to parity.

```
Nominal Exchange Rate = Foreign Price Level / Domestic Price Level
```

Alternatively, Nominal Exchange Rate is a measure of relative inflation between countries.

Purchasing power parity is limited in that, many goods are not easily traded, and even tradable goods are not perfect substitutions when purchased in different countries.

# Open economics analysis

Two markets are central to the analysis of open economics: loanable funds market and foreign currency market.

### Loanable funds market

```
National Saving = Domestic Investment + Net Capital Outflow
```

* Supply - National Saving
* Demand - Domestic Investment + Net Capital Outflow

Real interest rate balances the supply and demand.

Higher real interest rate --> Supply (the amount of loanable funds) goes up and demand goes down.

### Foreign currency market

```
Net exports = Net capital outflow
```

* Supply - net capital outflow, dollars supplied to buy foreign assets
* Demand - net exports, dollars demanded by foreigners to buy US exports
(The difference between increase in supply and decrease in demand can be more semantic rather than substantive.)

Real exchange rate balances the supply and demand in the market for foreign exchange.

Dollar strengthens, net exports drop.
(Supply curve is vertical because net capital outflow is not affected by real exchange rate: this is because capital invested abroad still wants to be exchanged back to dollars eventually.)

### How policies and events affect an open economy

Real interest rate is the price of present relative to the future, and real exchange rate price of domestic relative to abroad.
These two fluctuate and determine national saving, domestic investment, net capital outflow, and net exports.

Note that net capital outflow is part of the demand for loanable funds and because it provides the supply of dollars for foreign-currency exchange, it is the variable that connects these two markets -- when analyzing, we identify which curve between (Real Interest Rate - Loanable fund, Supply/Demand) and (Real Exchange Rate - Net Capital Outflow, Supply/Demand) should shift, and analyze the effect on the diagram accordingly.

* Government budget deficit
Saving negative, supply of loanable funds drop, interest rate rises, crowds out domestic investment.
Net capital outflow falls, dollar strengthens, net exports fall.

(government budget deficit and trade deficit move closely together.)

* Tariff / import quota

Import drops, net export rises (with exchange rate fixed), demand for dollar rises, dollar strengthens, net export drops to remain the same level as before.

Trade policies do not affect the overall trade balance. (they do not alter national saving or domestic investment)
They may, however, affect the trade balance of the particular industry for which the import quota affects. (just the overall balance is dragged back by averaging over other industries)

* Political instability and capital flight

Demand for loanable fund increases to fund foreign assets, interest rate rises, net capital outflow rises, exchange rate drops.

There is no universal good or bad direction for the dollar to move. The desirability of any shift in the exchange rate depends on why the dollar is moving.
(A big government deficit can cause similar strengthening effects as domestic innovations increasing demand for dollars.)
The exchange rate is the purview of market economics, not of the Treasury or strong-dollar ideologues.

One way any monetary expansion helps a distressed economy is by weakening the dollar. (foreign goods are more expensive -- more Americans are working)

* Chinese policy

China fixes the price of RMB, while US lets dollar value move in response to its supply and demand in fx markets.
The Chinese government has sometimes tried to depress the value of RMB, in foreign exchange markets to promote its export industries. It did this by accumulating foreign assets, including substantial amounts of US government bonds.

Yet the impact of the Chinese policy on the US economy was not all bad, the inflow of capital from China reduced US interest rates, which in turn increased investment in the US economy -- the Chinese government was financing US economic growth. The Chinese policy of investing in the US economy created winners and losers among Americans. All things considered, the net impact on the US economy was probably small.

Why does the Chinese hold such large foreign reserve? It may be a rainy day fund.

Policymakers and commentators are often quick to blame foreigners for problems facing the US economy.
By contrast, economists more often view these problems as homegrown.
Foreigners are a convenient target for politicians because blaming foreigners provides a way to avoid responsibility without insulting any domestic constituency.
The real solution (to trade deficit) might be to boost US national saving.

# Short run fluctuations

Previous notes were on the generation-to-generation scale, while this is on the year-to-year scale.

In the short run
* economics fluctuations (business cycle) are irregular and unpredictable
* most macroeconomics quantities fluctuate together (GDP, investment spending, unemployment rate)
* as output falls, unemployment rises

The theories of fluctuation remains controversial.
The analysis on which previous notes based, classical dichotomy and money neutrality, may not hold to explain short run fluctuations.

### Model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply

* (for a fixed amount of money supply) aggregate demand (of goods and services, a real value) slopes downward as price level (a nominal value, but because of fixed money supply this becomes a real value) rises
  * The wealth effect: a decrease in the price level raises the real value of money and makes consumers wealthier, which in turn encourages them to spend more. The increase in consumer spending means a larger quantity of goods and services demanded.
  * The interest rate effect: a lower price level also reduces the interest rate, encourages greater spending on investment goods, and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.
  * The exchange rate effect: when a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S. interest rates to fall, the real value of the dollar declines in foreign exchange markets. This depreciation stimulates U.S. net exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.

Shifts in the demand curve: changes in consumption (e.g. tax cut, stock market boom), investment (optimism, interest rate and money supply), government purchase, net exports. (Corresponds with the constituents of GDP.)

* in the long run, the aggregate supply curve is vertical, whereas in the short run, the aggregate-supply curve slopes upward as price level rises.
  * in the long run, supply is determined by supplies of labor, capital, natural resources, and available technologies to turn the factor of production into goods and services

Long-run trends are the background on which short run fluctuations are superimposed.

The key difference between the economy in the short run and in the long run is the behavior of aggregate supply: in the short run, rising price levels does increase supply.
Why? Market imperfection.
* The quantity of output supplied deviates from its long-run level when the actual price level in the economy deviates from the price level that people expected to prevail.
  * Sticky wage theory: wage adjustment lags price level change
  * Sticky price theory: price of some goods lags price level change (think menu cost)
  * The misperceptions theory: supplies responding to change in general price level as the change in their own goods' price level

An increase in the expected price level reduces the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left.
A decrease in the expected price level raises the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right.

Method of analysis is first identify is the (short term) event a left / right shift of supply or demand curve, then the new short-term equilibrium is found, then gradually the other (or the same) short-term curve would shift such that the vertical long-term-supply and the demand curve becomes balanced again.

Policymakers can adjust monetary policy to offset the short term event, such that the recession part of the curve shifts is not as painful.

* Shifts in aggregate supply can cause stagflation—a combination of recession (falling output) and inflation (rising prices).
* Policymakers who can influence aggregate demand can potentially mitigate the adverse impact on output but only at the cost of exacerbating the problem of inflation.

# The influence of monetary and fiscal policy on aggregate demand

Monetary: supply of money as set by central bank
Fiscal: government spending and taxation as set by the government

Recall the three effects that explain the downward slope of demand curve:
For the U.S. economy, the most important reason for the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve is the interest-rate effect.
Because money holding is a small part of household wealth, and imports/exports is a small fraction of US economy.

Theory of liquidity preference: "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money" Keynes: the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply of and demand for money. (both real and nominal interest rates)
