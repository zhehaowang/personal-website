# Essays of Warren Buffett

### Corporate management

* Trumpeting EBIDTA is sus
* Unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management
* CEOs claiming to know the future and always trumping earnings projections and growth expectation is sus

It's far easier for an inadequate CEO to keep their job, compared to a subordinate: performance standards are fuzzy.

Different manager/owner situations in public company:
* Corporation with no controlling shareholder (most common). Board is an agent between owners and management. Board of directors ought to mostly come from the outside. Board should be business savvy and have interest in the business, not selected for diversity / prominence, have the long term interest of shareholders in mind, and replace mediocre management -- may be difficult for board to deal with mediocrity.
* Controlling owner is the manager (like Berkshire). Usually facilitated by two classes of stock with disproportionate voting power. Board should resign if disagree with management -- limited what board can do, owner not going to fire themselves.
* Controlling owner not involved in management (like Hershey, Dow Jones). Board convinces the owner when unhappy with management -- board likely more effective.

Most CEOs are men and women you would be happy to have as trustees for your children's assets or as next-door neighbors.

Board "independence".
Most boards fail at their tasks of booting bad / finding good management and negotiating low enough fees of them (they are not incentivized / knowledgable / care enough to do that).

Buffett hires and attracts outstanding managers to run various businesses (through acquisition), those who love what they do and think like owners. With good managers, Buffett's job easily scales. Each such manager should run their business as if they own 100% of it, it's the only asset they'll ever have, and they can't sell or merge it for a century. Don't have them worry about board meetings, financing, credit ratings or Street's expectation of EPS (short term profits -- when short term and long term conflict, long term must take precedence).
If each of us hires smaller than we are, we become a company of dwarves. If each hires bigger than we are, we become a company of giants.

### Changing business

Berkshire Hathaway textile, passed onto good management. Then Buffett's entry into insurance, branching into candy and newspaper and liquidating textile business (being priced out by competition from foreign cheap labor).
Business synergy during acquisition.

The textile business had promising reduction in cost / expansions through large capital expenditure, viewed independently each were good investments, but competitors domestic and abroad are making the same investments, and viewed collectively the comparative edge was minimal.

Apply much brain power and energy to a faulty premise then you get nothing.
A textile company that allocates assets brilliantly is a remarkable textile company -- but the business itself is not remarkable.

Managerial record as measured by economic returns is far more a function of what business you are in, than how effectively you perform.
If you find yourself in a leaking boat, investing efforts into changing boat might be more productive than fixing leaks.

Newspaper used to be high returns -- no matter how inept the management they couldn't avoid profits gushing in.
Back when it used to be the primary source of information: even finding groceries and job opportunities.
The industry demonstrated survival of the fattest -- advertisers preferred wide circulation, and readers want the ones with the most ads and news pages.
The fattest in a city wins and without competition the profits starts to roll.

Those days are over. Fixed costs are high in newspaper and they are constantly losing ground to newer forms of media.
