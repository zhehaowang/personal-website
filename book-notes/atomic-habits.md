# Atomic Habits

The 1% marginal gains.
* Effect of time. Compounding.
* Small changes appear to make no difference, until the critical mass. We often times fail to realize the effects of the small changes, until they build up over time, for good or bad.

Your goal and your system.
* Goals are snapshots. Fix the snapshot, over time you may relapse.
* Goals hurt your happiness. After achieving something we can be happy.
* Goals are binary.
* System allows you to continue playing the game, not finishing the game.

You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your habits.

Small and easy habits as compound interest of self improvement: systematic improvement.

Good habits are hard to keep.
Unhealthy habits tend to be hard to break.

Are we changing the wrong thing?

Three levels of change: outcome, process, identity.
Focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you want to become.
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become.
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs and to upgrade and expand your identity.
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

Is this what a healthy / productive person would do?
Goal is not to read a book but to embrace the identity of a learned person, not to lose 30 pounds but to become a healthy person.

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to be automatic.
The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems in life with as little efforts and energy as possible.

Habit can be broke down into a feedback loop with four steps, cue, craving, response, and reward.
Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying.
