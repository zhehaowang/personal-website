# Basics of drawing

Tips on drawing straight line
* Grip
* Swift
* Focus on where you want the pencil to go
* Move your wrist, otherwise your line can't stay straight. Feel your wrist motion.

Right handed find it easiest to draw / , and most awkward \\ . Horizontal and vertical are somewhat awkward, too.

Gauging angles, clock face.

Triangulation.

Curved shapes, major axis, 
Identify where the curve can flow freely (characterized with fewer params)
Get your bounding boxes (e.g. height) right before trying to triangulate individual points.

making artwork is an editorial enterprise. We canâ€™t just slavishly copy what we see. Instead, we have to make decisions about what to include and what to leave out, based on what our materials can do for us.

Munsell System, hue, value (lightness) and chroma (saturation)
Theoretical black and white 0 and 10, pigments can achieve 0.5 to 9.5, graphite pencil can only go as dark as 3, hence compression is needed. No amount of pressure can make it draw any darker.

Charcoal can go as dark as 2. It's rich, dark and easily manipulated, but difficult to control.

Pencils are graphite, clay and polymer. Called lead because graphite is historically mistaken as lead, due to how much they look alike.
More clay the harder the pencil.

H hardness, B blackness.
Soft --> Hard.
9B - HB - F - 9H

Graphite does not mix well with charcoal, nor does chalk, due to difference in their texture.
Try to keep them as separate as possible in your drawing.

Don't assume there is anything special about your paper.
Experiment with different ones.
Paper has different Munsell values, e.g. 4 - 8.
"Tooth" of paper: don't use too toothy paper for this approach to drawing as drawing material tend to sit on top of the tooth. Blending tools can help with this, but still difficult.

Blending tools: stumps and brushes. Drag / smear graphite / chalk around the paper for short distances.
Brushes can be used in broader areas.
Use with caution as the tendency is to overblend and smooth away the transition that we worked hard to achieve.

Powdered graphite on a brush can be an efficient way to darken large areas, but can be quite messy.

At darker values, graphite tend to become shiny on the paper. It's not a property of graphite itself, but rather back and forth pencil movement burnishing the graphite spread on the paper, spreading them smooth.
This limits the viewing angles of your work.
Don't burnish.
H pencils contain more clay, and burnish less.
The less we use the B, the better in terms of burnish.

If you find yourself pressing your pencil too hard for the value, then it might be the pencil itself telling you it's too hard for the task.
On the other hand, if you find yourself having to hold your breath to get a lighter value, then the pencil is too soft.

Drawing a value scale, start soft and in a test area. Blending tools generally darkens. Squint to check.
Always sharpen your pencil.
