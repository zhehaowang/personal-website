# Scratch

Scratch is a playground for ideas in formulation / research stage.

As each matures their development effort will be tracked in dedicated docs and repos.

# Ideas

### Personal finance (research)

* What's a better investment strategy than dollar cost averaging on SPY
  * Are new issues generally better or worse?
  * Various indexes, sectors, geolocations?
  * Over trading, tax implications?
  * Diversification, what has been the correlation between different instruments?
  * Daily symbol open, close, high, low, volume would be easily available; what about events, earnings, IPO, merge and splits, shoc, and intraday data? What about other instruments, real estate, bonds, fx, crypto?
  * How to approach this problem? What are some good criteria to accept one theory and reject another?

### Events, social connection automation (engineering)

* What are some cool things happening around me? Who has been attending what, paying / clicking likes on whom else? Given an ID, can I build a system such that all info of interest to me about that person would pop up?

### Memory (engineering)

* There is something poetic about memory ([some recent thoughts](https://github.com/zhehaowang/zhehao.me/blob/master/essays/memory-and-bigtable.md)) and I wonder how I can capture such in my work.
  * To build an experience around the beauty / melancholiness in remembering / forgetting.

### A home for zhehao.me (engineering)

* Should I build a website around this repo to host my work and thoughts?
* It should ideally be easy to maintain and migrate, is no more burden to contribute to than writing a markdown, queryable, not a pain to look at

### KTLO, general learning

Let's compact some of these and move them to done section
* [Distributed system: designing data intensive application](https://github.com/zhehaowang/zhehao.me/tree/master/book-notes/data-intensive-application)
* [Intro to linguistics](https://github.com/zhehaowang/zhehao.me/tree/master/book-notes/story-of-human-language)
* [Intro to philosophy](https://github.com/zhehaowang/zhehao.me/tree/master/book-notes/philosophy-ideas)
* [Intro to photography](https://github.com/zhehaowang/zhehao.me/blob/master/tech-notes/)

Let's keep an eye out to reinspect our routines and try out new things
* Setups, toolchain, IDE
* Cool stuff in general

# Methodology

### Goal driven research / development

* What question do I want to answer? (and why)
* What research has already been done? What knowledge should I acquire in order to gain good intuition for formulating the problem and coming up with hypotheses to test?
* How do I formulate / quantize the problem into hypothesis?
* To test such hypothesis what data do I need? What program do I need to write? What are the bottlenecks? How do I plan to use such data?
* What are my conclusions? If I can't arrive at any conclusions, backtrack and try again.

### Reasonable documentation

* If we seriously pursue a project, then it should be committed to durable storage.
  * What did we do? Why? Keys on how? What are our conclusions? Did we succeed or fail? What lessons did we learn?
  * What would future me in two years wanting to pick this up again want to know?
  * Content we committed need not be immutable: if they happen to be let's at least run compaction

### Focus

* One can scratch multiple things at the same time, but let's focus one and only one thing in active development. That would be the theme. (similar to the principle of a good photograph should have one and only one subject)

# Reference

* The Creative Habit:

Scratching as the first step of a creative act is like groping in the dark, random and chaotic, feverish and fearful.

We scratch for ideas through reading, everyday conversation, people's handiwork, mentors and heroes, and nature.
