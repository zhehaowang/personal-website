# The first principles

There seems layers of principles behind many arts in life.

The Platonic school would differentiate facts and the truth, where a fact can be a drawn triangle is rectilinear, and truth being any triangle demonstrating `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` is rectilinear.

This resonates with our observations on generalization and specialization.

The Aristotelian program, its four modalities, the final cause and rationality defined by being able to perceive generality, also suggests there is "what is it for" in every art and technique, i.e. the first principle.

Memory of the specialized fades, but a grasp on the first principle, generalized from the individual instances, usually holds firm.

The first principle of photography revolves around the strength (or peculiarity) of the subject.
The elements and their arrangement, your lighting, depth of field and shutter speed, as well as editing decisions, all serve to bring out the strengths of the subject, to guide the audience to appreciate such as you had, and to not distract.

From this principle, specialized guidelines become intuitive.
E.g. casting hard lighting to bring out a three-dimensional shape, applying monochrome when colors will distract, seeking leading lines and frame, and posing your model's back or waist in an S-shape with a gap between arms and waistline.

The first principle of linguistic seems to be the change. Some innate complexity plus the natural dissolution, shifts and variations, on top of which geopolitical influence, diglossia, pidgins and creoles.

The first principle of software architecture seems the design of reasonable abstractions and the tradeoff that ensues.
Single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion all describe something about the ideal abstractions, or the technique to maximize its benefits on your architecture.

The first principle of algorithmic optimization revolves asymptotic complexity and memory access pattern.
Taking one step back, the first principle of performance optimization could be algorithmic or systematic.

Ultimately, the first principle of problem solving seems the dynamic to identify and overcome obstacles on the evolve critical path.
With the why (the end goal) in mind, tracing back to identify what needs to be done, and coming back with how.

When generalizing to the first principle, especially the principles of high-level abstract topics like problem solving, the claim almost seems apparent and of not much practical implication.

This perhaps echos with Plato's observation in Meno that truth is not something taught, rather something we inherently know but (sometimes dormant and) awakened via dialectical discourse.
The realization seems one such process of the truth, or the first principle being awakened.

How are principles formulated? Does dialectical methods apply to natural sciences? Does it not carry practical implications?

What about the principle of financial investment? Designing a distributed system? Living a healthy and productive life? Interacting with people? Effective communication? Music composition? Poetry? Decision making?

Is the principle different from the key features to uphold such that the art is declared to be performed in an agreeable way?
Or is the principle a key universal observation about an objective phenomenon, from which effects of such phenomenon, or those like it can be deduced?
Are these different? Does the difference imply anything?
