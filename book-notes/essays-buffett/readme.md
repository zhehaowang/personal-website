# Essays of Warren Buffett

### Corporate management

* Trumpeting EBIDTA is sus
* Unintelligible footnotes usually indicate untrustworthy management
* CEOs claiming to know the future and always trumping earnings projections and growth expectation is sus

It's far easier for an inadequate CEO to keep their job, compared to a subordinate: performance standards are fuzzy.

Different manager/owner situations in public company:
* Corporation with no controlling shareholder (most common). Board is an agent between owners and management. Board of directors ought to mostly come from the outside. Board should be business savvy and have interest in the business, not selected for diversity / prominence, have the long term interest of shareholders in mind, and replace mediocre management -- may be difficult for board to deal with mediocrity.
* Controlling owner is the manager (like Berkshire). Usually facilitated by two classes of stock with disproportionate voting power. Board should resign if disagree with management -- limited what board can do, owner not going to fire themselves.
* Controlling owner not involved in management (like Hershey, Dow Jones). Board convinces the owner when unhappy with management -- board likely more effective.

Most CEOs are men and women you would be happy to have as trustees for your children's assets or as next-door neighbors.

Board "independence".
Most boards fail at their tasks of booting bad / finding good management and negotiating low enough fees of them (they are not incentivized / knowledgable / care enough to do that).

Buffett hires and attracts outstanding managers to run various businesses (through acquisition), those who love what they do and think like owners. With good managers, Buffett's job easily scales. Each such manager should run their business as if they own 100% of it, it's the only asset they'll ever have, and they can't sell or merge it for a century. Don't have them worry about board meetings, financing, credit ratings or Street's expectation of EPS (short term profits -- when short term and long term conflict, long term must take precedence).
If each of us hires smaller than we are, we become a company of dwarves. If each hires bigger than we are, we become a company of giants.

### Changing business

Berkshire Hathaway textile, passed onto good management. Then Buffett's entry into insurance, branching into candy and newspaper and liquidating textile business (being priced out by competition from foreign cheap labor).
Business synergy during acquisition.

The textile business had promising reduction in cost / expansions through large capital expenditure, viewed independently each were good investments, but competitors domestic and abroad are making the same investments, and viewed collectively the comparative edge was minimal.

Apply much brain power and energy to a faulty premise then you get nothing.
A textile company that allocates assets brilliantly is a remarkable textile company -- but the business itself is not remarkable.

Managerial record as measured by economic returns is far more a function of what business you are in, than how effectively you perform.
If you find yourself in a leaking boat, investing efforts into changing boat might be more productive than fixing leaks.

Newspaper used to be high returns -- no matter how inept the management they couldn't avoid profits gushing in.
Back when it used to be the primary source of information: even finding groceries and job opportunities.
The industry demonstrated survival of the fattest -- advertisers preferred wide circulation, and readers want the ones with the most ads and news pages.
The fattest in a city wins and without competition the profits starts to roll.

Those days are over. Fixed costs are high in newspaper and they are constantly losing ground to newer forms of media.

### Social compacts

Railroad and energy utilities ventures.

The business and the public both should behave in a way that encourages good behavior from the other.

### Owner based approach to corporate charity

Most directors, as representatives of owners, direct funds to their favorite charities, and the choice is not up to owners themselves.
Berkshire allows owner to participate in the company's charity donation.

### Executive pay

Measure manager's performance using return on investment, not just return.

Rewarding manager with fixed price long term option doesn't put managers and owners in the same financial boat: the holder of this option bears no capital cost, but the owner cannot escape capital cost.

For a manager incentivized by fixed price long term option, it might be beneficial for him to eschew dividends payment and use all earnings to buy back shares (while keeping a constant p/e ratio) -- driving up stock prices but serving no interest of owners or improving the business. "Heads I win, tails you lose".

Every dime paid out in dividends reduce the value of all outstanding options.
In the executive suite today, it may be that nothing succeeds like failure.

In Berkshire, performance of a manager is defined in different ways depending upon the underlying economics of the (subsidiary) business unit and not on the Berkshire stock price. Compensate for returns they generate as well as capital they release.

In recent years compensation committees too often have been tail-wagging puppy dogs meekly following recommendations by consultants, a breed not known for allegiance to the faceless shareholders who pay their fees.

### Risk, reputaion and oversight

A CEO must not delegate risk control -- it's too important.

Audit committee, auditors.

Culture. Flexibility w.r.t. capital allocation and alignment between owners and managers. Bureaucracy begets bureaucracy.

# Finance and investing

### Farm, real estate, and stock

The key to successful investing was the purchase of shares in good businesses when market prices were at a large discount from underlying business values.

On his farm and real estate investments
* You don't need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren't, you must recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don't swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick no.
* Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don't feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset's future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate every investment possibility. But omniscience isn't necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.
* If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating. There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. The fact that a given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.
* Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time. Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important.

Difference with stocks: the valuation of his real estate investments weren't known and broadcasted all the time.

Owners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits—and, worse yet, important to consider acting upon their comments.

When Buffett buys stocks (thought of as small portions of businesses),
* first have to decide whether we can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out, or more (economic prospects, people in charge).
* If the answer is yes, we will buy the stock (or business) if it sells at a reasonable price in relation to the bottom boundary of our estimate.
* If, however, we lack the ability to estimate future earnings—which is usually the case—we simply move on to other prospects. 
Never foregone an attractive purchase because of the macro or political environment.
Buying without having in mind the time to sell.

### Mr Market

Mr. Market is here to serve you, not guide you. It will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.

If you aren't certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market you don't belong in the game.

In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.

The hamburger analogy in stocks market.

### Arbitrage

Buffett prefers long term investment, but often there's more cash than good ideas.
Engaging these cash in short term corporate action arbitrage might be better than T-bill in returns.

Questions to ask
* How likely is it that the promised event will indeed occur
* How long will your money be tied up
* What chance is there that something still better will transpire—a competing takeover bid, for example
* What will happen if the event does not take place because of anti-trust action, financing glitches, etc

Berkshire arbitrage diversifies little.
