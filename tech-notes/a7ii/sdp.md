### Tips

* Take lots of pictures
* Try different viewpoints
* Travel light
* Learn your camera, learn to use fill flash and bounce flash (flash isn't just for dark spaces)
* Use your pictures, post online, build a portfolio
* Know your final format (how it's going to be used, size, horizontal, vertical, aspect ratio)
* Make a great thumbnail
* Get another opinion
Sometimes a photographer's emotions or focus on the technical details of a picture, like sharpness and contrast, can hinder his or her ability to judge the aesthetics that most non-photographers can just feel.
Outside opinions, no matter where they are from, are valuable.
* Edit (the best of) your images
* Make pictures, don't just take them
  * Envision a photograph, find the best location, find the best viewpoint, find the best time, determine how the natural light needs to be adjusted.
  * Hold the camera up, identify the right exposure, perspective, background blur, depth-of-field, press the shutter
  * Edit the picture.
* Evaluate your photography: experience, planning, camera. Get better gears only after you learn how to plan a shot.
* Don't worry so much about the equipment and settings.
* Get an extra battery and SD card. Never close an empty door: when you have your SD card / battery out, leave the empty door open so you know you are missing something.

"Be there and think": the subject, the location, the perspective, the lighting, the timing, the weather, the mood, the pose, the clothes, the expression, the composition and the camera settings.

"I'd rather you leave your camera in auto mode than become preoccupied with any one aspect of making a picture, especially the equipment and settings."

### Composition

What do you want to convey? What is the story you are trying to tell?
What is your subject, and what are some visual cues in the image?

Some things to consider,
* Rule of thirds, try placing your subject at one third towards an edge
* Rule of space, if the subject is moving or looking towards a direction, leave space in that direction such that the picture does not seem crowded
* Focal point, you might see a gorgeous landscape around you, but without a focal point, the picture will come out boring as the eye disregards the scene as background. If you can't find a focal point in a landscape picture, use the sun, ask a friend or yourself to pose. The idea is to try creating an anchor in the image for the eyes to rest upon
* Simplifying / subtraction: did you include anything in the frame that would distract the eyes?
* Angle of view, choose your fore/background, depth of field (lens focal length, f stop, distance to subject, flash). Some things to consider: foreground as a stepping stone to introduce the subject. Or if you want to convey isolation, maybe the foreground would be too much of a distraction.
* Showing scale: you may lose the scale of your subject with too much simplification. If you need to show the scale of your subject, include something of known size.
* Leading lines, they don't have to be straight, towards the subject you want the audience to focus on. What if you don't have them: can you have objects placement that would help cue / balance the image? When a picture has prominent lines, make sure your camera is level. If you want angled lines, make sure it's at least 20-30 degrees off level. 5-degree would just look careless.
* Repeated patterns can leave the impression of something being boundless
* Symmetry, often you need to align the picture perfectly and disregard the rule of thirds
* A flat image (square composition) is often times uninteresting, to show depth, try placing a focal point in front or shooting from an angle. But if you want to convey a stately, formal, and professional attitude, a square composition (with symmetry) might be preferable
* Consider using Dutch angle (a deliberate 15-30 degrees tilt) to convey liveliness, casual and fun. Typically not a good choice for portraits and landscapes.
* Consider combining multiple shots in post-processing for panoramic effect (requires your ae (auto exposure) lock on, and pictures to overlap about one-third)
* Balance and visual weights: subjects in a picture balance by visual weights (size, brightness, color, sharpness, and direction). Compose a visually balanced image.
* Scan the edges of the frame: did you get something you don't want (the camera and our eyes may see things differently, whereas our eyes may filter out the unwanted in an image, the camera would capture them faithfully)? Do your subjects require a little more headroom?
* When shooting black and white, think black and white, focus on the form, texture and composition. Shoot raw, lower the iso. Do it when, e.g. background colors would be distracting.
* Storytelling, mood
* Deliberating breaking the rules

### Lighting

The most amazing subject will be boring when the lighting is bad, and even dull subjects come alive with great lighting.

Every scene has highlights, shadows, and the transitions between them.

**Soft lighting** creates long, smooth transitions between highlights and shadows while **hard lighting** creates sharp transitions.
Hard lighting shows form (3-dimensional, e.g.) and texture, while soft lighting shows shape.

Hard lighting is created by small or faraway light sources while soft lighting is created by large nearby light sources.

Direct sunlight or a bare bulb creates hard lighting, while reflected and diffused light creates soft lighting (e.g. octobox when shooting portraits, or a diffuser before a point light source).
Reflexvive surfaces vs curving shapes, and how they react to light.

Between highlights and shadows are the mid-tones. In soft lighting most of a picture is mid-tones.
Cameras capture mid-tones best. In hard lighting pictures can consist entirely of highlights and shadows with nothing in between. Only the most skilled are able to take great pictures in hard lighting.

The direction of the main light (key light) can change the look of your subject.
Highlights draw attention to features. Shadows diminish and hide features.
Whether photographing person or landscape, choose lighting that highlights the focal point.

* Top lighting gives a natural appearance, but it casts unattractive shadows on faces. Avoid this when shooting portrait.
* Front lighting is better for faces but it removes texture and depth. Flattering for portrait, unideal for architecture and landscape because it removes depth. Your camera's built-in flash creates front lighting.
* Side lighting highlights texture, form and depth and casts long shadows. Side lighting in portraits make pores and blemishes across the face seem exaggerated. 
* Back lighting creates the most dramatic effects but can be challenging to work with. They tend to be all highlights and shadows with few mid-tones. Even worse, the background tends to be highlighted while the foreground in shadows. For portraits, back lighting creates a ring of light around the face that can be very flattering. Similarly for flowers, animals, etc. Backlighting makes your subject silhouette, and forces the viewer to concentrate on shape by eliminating texture, color and form. An ethereal and monochrome style. "Backlighting is one of the rare scenarios that require a good quality lens". Grass and reeds are a good choice for subjects.

Your environment interacts with light. All light is hard when it leaves its source; your environment softens and diffuses it.
If you want to reduce the amount of reflected light, put a polarizing filter on your lens.

* Golden, sun being low, right after sunrise or before sunset. More directional, and soft. Think landscape with hills and textures upon which shadows are cast. Light and shadow, depth and drama. Clouds have similar effect: part of the scene are lit. Warm golden glow. During golden hours sky is also typically less hazy, making your pictures sharper and creating better contrasts. Important for shooting fall colors. For landscape photography, plan your trip around golden hours. Check out www.photoephemeris.com and google earth, toggle time and plan your shot.
* Blue, right before sunrise or after sunset. Sun's below the horizon, light's reflected from the atmosphere, taking away contrast and evenly lit. Ambient, soft. Narrow time frame. 
* Flat, generally poor for landscape: not much contrast, depth. Overcast flat light can work in particular cases, e.g. with overcast cloud, on waterfalls. Consider desaturating, black and white to bring out the texture / mood of the scene.

* Flash
  * Fill flash. Say you are shooting a model in daylight under an overcast sky, and want to reduce shadows from the eyes / face by adding a front lighting. Control flash output using flash exposure compensation (try aperture priority or shutter priority with this).
  * Bounce flash. Attaching an external flash to change the angle of lighting, or have lighting bounce off a wall. This wouldn't work outside without bouncing your flash off a reflector. (requires low, white ceilings). Broad lighting (main light closer to the side of face closer to the camera), short lighting.
  * High speed sync option. Motion with flash.

Proper catchlight (light reflected from the eyes, ideally, above the center of the pupils) is critical to portrait and wildlife photography.

As long as your eyes are open, you can study light and shadow.

* Color temperature
  * Different light sources, e.g. candles, sunrise, moonlight, daylight / flash (warm --> cold), have different color temperatures.
  * Lower color temperature are considered warm, as they cast an orange light.
  * Cameras may apply auto white balancing (think multiple light sources with different temperatures), which may be off and can be adjusted in postprocessing. Our eyes apply auto white balancing as well, lights warm or cold often mis-appear as white to our eyes.

### Camera control

* Focal plane; focusing modes
* Back button focus; focus traps; precise focusing using live view
* 

### Portraits

* The subject of a portrait is rarely the entire person, but instead their facial expression, and you should consider cropping around the face.

### Example subjects

* Still life photography: arrangements / composition; choosing props: symbolism, interaction with light. Good practice for theories.
* Levitation photography, editting trick
* Multiple exposures, silhouette one picture on (the dark portrait in) another

# Adobe Lightroom

* Exposure, exposure compensation on camera
* Adjusting highlights down can sharpen the details
* Shadow
* White and black clips the histogram
* Vibrance, saturation can bring out the color
* Noise reduction, sharpening
* Sensor dust (spot removal)
* Copy settings to other pictures

* Wildlife / portrait, if you didn't catch the eye, you didn't take the shot
