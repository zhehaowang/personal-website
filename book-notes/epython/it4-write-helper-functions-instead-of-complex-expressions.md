### Write helper functions instead of complex expressions


**Takeaways**
* Python's syntax makes it all too easy to write single-line expressions that are overly complicated and difficult to read
* Move complex expressions into helper functions, especially if you need to use the same logic repeatedly
* if/else expression provides a more readable alternative to boolean operators like or and and in expressions.
