# Sapiens

### Cognitive revolution

What separates homo sapiens from homo erectus, or neanderthal? The former is the predominant human race, while the DNA of the latter can hardly be traced to modern human beings. (some neanderthal DNAs were able to be found to modern day human beings)

Homo sapiens were hunter gatherers / foragers.
Ache society in Paraguay are hunter gatherers living to this day, with the tradition of killing off the old and the infants who can't keep up with the tribe. Yet do we live in a happier society than them?

The cognitive revolution saw homo sapiens' brains being able to process something purely fictional, like laws, or the United States of America.
This power to process something imaginary lets us grasp far more things than what's encoded in our DNA.
The course of natural evolution runs much slower than that of our cognitive revolution.
In turn, such understandings are not preserved by the species: it's not in our DNA, rather, it dies as the individual bearing it dies.

Cognitive revolution allows homo sapiens to band together in much larger numbers under shared myths, e.g. that of religion or nationalism, and collaborate in ways far more flexible than what's encoded in our DNA.

### Agricultural revolution

Did homo sapiens domesticate the wheat, or did wheat domesticate homo sapiens?
Our bone structures were not evolved naturally to take care of wheat, nor our lifestyle.

Is the success of a species to be judged by the average of individual happiness, or by how many replicas of its DNA it was able to reproduce?
Homo sapiens, especially after the agricultural revolution, are hugely successful in terms of the latter, but may be questionable in terms of the former.
There is no going back in the agricultural revolution.

The collective myths. Objective, subjective, inter-subjective. Something prevalent in the minds of a multitude of subjects does not make it objective.
The myth of modern time could be considered as that of consumerism and romanticism: broadening our horizon via consuming different kinds of experiences. E.g., that of traveling abroad.

An Egyptian noble would probably not consider travelling to Babylon with his wife a desirable form of entertainment, they'd much rather be building an expensive tomb, perhaps.

Summerian writing. Catalogging. A scribe system.



Seeing what-is often times make us take what-is as granted: there is no other way.
There is every other way just that for which you don't have the eyes to see.
