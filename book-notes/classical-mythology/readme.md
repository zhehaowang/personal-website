# Classical Mythology

### Genesis, Hesiod Theogony

(Hesiod's other major work, Work and Days, is much like a farming manual.)

* Chaos
* Gaia, Tartarus, Eros, Erebus, Hemera, Nyx
* Uranus - Gaia
* Cronus - Rhea
* Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter

Hestia (home, hearth) is rarely mentioned in literature, almost negligible in mythology, but presumably very important in religion.

* Zeus - Hera
Ares (whom everyone hates), Enyo, Hebe, Eileithyia (childbirth), Eris (discord), Hephaestus (Hera by herself)

* Zeus - Metis (wisdom)
Athena (from Zeus's head. Zeus swallows Metis who gave birth to Athena inside Zeus. Metis's son is prophecied to overthrow Zeus. One of the rare cases where gods / mortals cheat fate. Greeks believed thoughts / wisdom comes from the torso, and Metis gave counsel to Zeus from inside his belly.)

### The Titan Prometheus

In men's meeting with gods at Mecone to decide sacrifice, **Prometheus** tried to trick Zeus into picking the pile of bones covered by meat and fat as sacrifice, and leaving the pile of meat covered by bones and unedible parts to human. Zeus knew and decided to punish Prometheus by punishing men, and took fire from them.

Prometheus later stole fire and gave it back to men, for which act he was chained to a pillar and his liver grew everyday to be eaten by an eagle.
Zeus punished men, too, for Prometheus stealing fire, by giving men the first woman, named **Pandora** in **Work and Days**.

Heracles rescued Prometheus from the chain.

Greek gods have little care for human beings.

While these are from **Theogony**, many anecdotes / stories we hear today are actually from Ovid's **Metamorphoses** (a collection of stories about transformation e.g. Apollo and the nymph Daphne (the story of laurel), Phaethon son of Apollo asking to ride the chariot of the sun for a day, and **Narcissus** falling in love in his own reflection in water).

### Demeter, Persephone, the Eleusinian Mysteries, seasons, and Greek view of life and death

Persephone's abduction by Hades and splitting her time in the underworld vs Mount Olympus resulted in the seasons where one third of the year crops don't grow.

As told by the Homeric Hymn on Demeter (Homeric in time and style but not by Homer), during Demeter's search for Persephone, she visited Eleusis disguised as a crone and babysitted the queen's son, whom she intended to bring to immortality by anointing and throwing into the fire.
The plan was foiled by the queen who happened upon the ritual, angering Demeter and causing the death of the prince.

**The Eleusinian Mysteries** were a cult ritual dedicated to Demeter in which only the initiated were told of the rituals.
Our view of what the ritual is about preserved from those of the potentially biased early Christian authors.
Presumably symbolisms of life and death.

While **the Greek view of afterlife** is in general pretty grim: most men became shadows / images in the grim world of Tartarus, except extraordinary souls or terrible sinners (e.g. Tantalus who intended to trick the gods into eating flesh by serving his own son, whose shoulder only Demeter ate mistakenly, resulting in an ivory shoulder when the gods bring the son back), the Eleusinian Mysteries might have offered a brighter view.

Note that the general grim view differs from traditional belief of Christianity or Islam, in that the latter believes the afterlife / the eternal is the important part and the deeds of this life would affect that of the afterlife, while the former places its emphasis on this life and rarely after-death consequences of one's deeds in this life.

**Orphism** is another cult dealing with life and death. The teaching of the mortal Orpheus (who, surprisingly some sources claim, is the child of Apollo and a muse) while in the underworld trying to bring back his dead wife Eurydice.
Persuaded by his superb music, Hades and Persephone gave their consent on the condition that Orpheus does not look back when leading Eurydice out of the underworld, which he failed to do.

Reincarnation might have been a central concept in Orphism, which took a view like that of Buddhism, that reincarnation / cycle-after-cycle is something one wants to escape from, and one does it by saying certain things to certain gods in the underworld.

### Apollo and Artemis

Children of Zeus and Leto (who is of little mythological importance otherwise)

**Apollo** of medicine and plague, youth and sudden death (struck by the arrow of Apollo), all the creative arts (administers over the Muses), rationality, prophesy (delegated by Zeus), and later on associated with the Sun.
Depicted as a male in 20s with bow and quiver showing that of typical youthful manly beauty.

**Pythia** (prietess of the Oracle of Delphi) delivers the words of Apollo to those seeking prophesy, which are most of the time ambiguous in nature, e.g. Croesus of Lydia was told if he attacks the Persians he would destroy a great empire (that of his own).

**Motto at the Oracle of Delphi**: know yourself, nothing in excess.
Know yourself in the sense of knowing your limitations and not offend the god. (Queen of Thebes suggested she should be worshipped for having 14 children while Leto only has two, and all her children were struck dead by Apollo and Artemis.)

**Artemis** the huntress, goddess of animals, the untamed, women before marriage, and the young.

Hestia, Artemis and Athena are chaste goddesses of Greek myths.
In Artemis's case, it's potentially related with her representation of the untamed: sex is viewed as domination, and in one Greek dialect the word wife came from the word tamed.
Her association with hunting is also related with protection of the young, which hunters often times do for sustainability.
Her most famous place of worship in Turkey near Selcuk, temple at Ephesus.

### Hermes and Dionysus

**Hermes** of exchange, of commerce, trading, thieves, beggars, boundaries, the messenger, and deliverers of souls to the underworld.

Hermes invented the lyre from tortoise shells, and traded it with Apollo for a cattle he stole from Apollo in the first place.

The pillar herma is associated with Hermes: herma represents boundaries (those of a market, e.g.) and usually depicts a bearded god with an erect phallus.
The pillar is sacred and their mass destruction before Alcibiades's expedition to Syracuse was a serious matter that caused him being investigated.

**Dionysus** of madness, irrationality, frenzy, growth of wild plants and wine.

Male worshippers, **Satyrs**, are human with beast features such as horse tails, and later on goat below the waist, always in a frenzy.
Female worshipers, **maenad**, are human women who has the strength to tear wild animals apart.

Nietzsche find greek culture often times representing **the contrast of Apollonian reason and Dionysian madness**.

Dionysus is often associated with tragic and comedian traditions of Athens, perhaps due to their origins in rituals and actors impersonating someone else bears some similarity to Dionysian irrationality.

**Euripides's Bacchae** describes birth of Dionysus: Zeus in disguise bedded mortal woman Semele, whose nanny Hera disguised as out of jealousy and suggested Semele verify her partner is indeed a god and not pretending to be one, by asking him to swear on the river Styx to fulfill one wish of Semele's, which Zeus did.
Semele asks him to reveal his true glory, which incinerated her.
Zeus took her embryo Dionysus and nurtured him in his thigh from where Dionysus is born.
He is thus sometimes referred to as the twice born.
The jealous Theban siblings of Semele refused to acknowledge Dionysus's divine status, for this slight Dionysus drove the women of Thebes mad and tore apart the siblings.

### Aphrodite

Sexual passion.

Quite a different concept as modern perception of love, in its being transient / ephemeral.

She was born from Uranus's genitals in Theogony, or child of Zeus and Dione in Iliad.

Aeneas son of Anchises and Aphrodite (Zeus giving Aphrodite a taste of her own medicine. Gods, men and animals are said to be unable to resist Aphrodite's power, except the three chaste goddesses).
Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite tells the story of Anchises and Aphrodite, who lied to the former of being a mortal woman.
Aeneas being the hero of Aeneid and claimed ancestor of Romans.

No good ever comes of the union between men and goddesses.
Examples including Adonis killed for his relationship with Aphrodite, and Tithonus and Eos the goddess of dawn.
Zeus agreed in Eos's plead to make Tithonus immortal but she forgot to ask for youth.
Tithonus ages but never dies and eventually became just a babbling voice that Eos shut away.

Sexual relationship between an older man and an adolescent young man is often seen as Ok in greek myths, but not other forms of homosexuality.

Maybe it does not make sense to question the ancient Greeks whether they believe in their gods, who are personifications of natural forces.
To ask if an ancient Greek believes in Aphrodite would be like asking if he acknowledges the presence of sexual passion.

Ancient Greek belief in god(s) could be very different from monotheistic worship of God or Allah, and the perspective is usually quite different if someone outside a cultural group were to inspect that group's myths.

### Minoan and Mycenaean civilzations

**Minoan civilization** prospered on Crete in about 2000BC, its literature in two writings, linear A and linear B were left, the latter was not yet deciphered.

**Mycenaean civilization** prospered about 1600 to 1100BC, after which a Greek dark age followed: Mycenaeans seemed to have lost their ability to create intricate artwork and magnificent cities.
Trojan war and the Heroic Age was towards the end of the Mycenaean golden age.
Homer's work came after this time, but has description of ancient Greek cities verified by modern day archaeologists to match excavated Mycenaean cities.
His description may have been transcribed from oral traditions that traced back to historic events during that time.

### The Five Ages

Works and Days described the human race going through the
* golden age (rein of Cronus, no strife or turmoil, long lives),
* silver age (Zeus. Long childhood, 100 years lifespan, destroyed by Zeus for impiety),
* bronze age (Created by Zeus from ash tree (common material for spear shaft). War-like and violent, ended with Deucalion's flood),
* heroic age (an improvement compared with bronze age, heroes and the Trojan War) and
* iron age (Hesiod's time, there's no help against evil, and eventually the grim vision that babies will be born grey-haired due to worries). 

### Story of Theseus, unifier of Attica

The test and quest pattern in Greek myth stories.

Dual fathership, Aegis king of Athens and Poseidon both mated with the same woman on the same night, the daughter of a king whose land the former's passed by on his way back from the Oracle at Delphi.

Aegis told Theseus's mother about a pair of sandals and a sword under a boulder, and that if she bore a son when the son is old enough to lift the boulder, collect the items and head to Athens.

On his way Theseus slew Procrustes, who insists travelers stay in his bed and that they must fit the bed: too tall lop off their legs, too short stretch them.

Aegis's then wife, **Medea** tried to poison Theseus but the plan was foiled by Theseus drawing his sword to cut the meat and Aegis recognizing the sword thus Theseus being his son (common theme, reunion and the last minute). Medea escaped.

Theseus then volunteered as tribute to Minos to feed the minotaur, whom he slew with the help of princess Ariadne (common theme, help of a young woman).
The latter provided him with a ball of threads, **the clue of Ariadne**, to guide him out of the labyrinth.

Theseus took her with him back on the ship to Athens, but apparently forgot about her on an island on the way back.

Dionysus later rescued Ariadne, married her and made her a goddess. This is quite unusual and prompts assumptions that Ariadne was a Cretan goddess.
Theseus also forgot about raising white sails as promised, causing Aegis's suicide.

After becoming king he tried to marry three times.
* First being abducting the young Helen, then journeying with Pirithous (the duo conspired to marry daughters of Zeus, Theseus picked Helen and Pirithous picked Persephone) to the underworld to abduct Persephone, but tricked by Hades and got stuck on stone chairs only to be rescued later by Heracles (common theme in hero's justification: running into Heracles). (Pirithous was left in the underworld and Theseus returned to Athens to find Helen rescued by his brothers.)
* Theseus then abducted Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons (another common theme in heroes' encounter), who died giving birth to Hippolytus. Theseus defeated Amazons trying to rescue their queen.
* In **Euripides's play Hippolytus**, Theseus then marries Phaedra, sister of Ariadne and daughter of Minos. Phaedra wanted Hippolytus, was refused due to the latter's oath of chastity, and hanged herself leaving a letter accusing Hippolytus of raping her. Theseus exiled Hippolytus and the latter died, after which Theseus learnt of Phaedra's lies.

The timeline of Theseus's story seems hopelessly confused: Minos lived three generations before the Trojan War, Heracles one generation before, yet Theseus encountered both and abducted Helen.

Presumably Theseus held such importance in Athens that they needed to connect him with every major plot in classical myths.

Yet his origins may correspond with historical events: archaeologists uncovered a ritual / sport handling bulls, and Athens very well could be paying tribute to Minoan civilization in Theseus's time.

Minotaur is the offspring of Minos's wife queen of Crete with a bull.
Minos promised to offer the bull to Poseidon but instead offered a lesser animal.
Poseidon enlisted the aid of Aphrodite to make the queen desire the bull, and the best artisan in Crete crafted her a disguise as a cow to mate with the bull and conceived Minotaur.
The labyrinth in which Minotaur's locked is designed by the same artisan.

Theseus's story represents that of a rite of adulthood of a male.

### Heracles

Pan-Hellenic hero and god.
Son of Zeus and a human mother Alcmene a descendant of Perseus.

Life of hardship because of jealousy of Hera.

Birth. Descendant of Perseus, by Zeus's decree to be king of Mycenae, trick of Hera, strangling the snakes.

A man of excessive appetite, sexuality (impregnated 50 daughters of a king in one night, many later Greek kings traces back to this e.g. king of Sparta) and rage.
Depicted naked with his lion skin and club.

Killed his wife Megara and his children in his rage.

Told by the Pythia to accomplish 12 labors in service to his cousin the king of Mycenae to redeem himself and become immortal.

The first 6 in Peloponnese related with animals
* Nemean lion
* nine-headed hydra
* bringing back Artemis's hind
* Erymanthian Boar
* Augean stables
* Stymphalian Birds

The next 3 farther away
* man-eating mares of Thrace
* bull of Crete
* Hippolyta's girdle (belt)

The last 3 in the far west associated with death and immortality,
* driving back cattle of monster Geryon,
* golden apples of the goddesses daughters of the night guarded by a dragon,
* bringing back Cerberos the guarddog of the underworld.

Marries Deianira afterwards, killed Nessus a centaur who attempted to rape Deianira with arrow poisoned by the blood of the hydra.
Centaur persuades Deianira to keep his blood as a love potion when Heracles loses interest in her someday in the future, Deianira did and soaked a cloak in the centaur's blood.
Heracles did lose interest in her, and Deianira brought out the cloak to Heracles which he wore, which tore his skins and exposed his bones.
In great agony he threw himself upon a funeral pire and died.
His psyche (soul) then joined and Olympians and he married Hebe as a god.

A man of great contrasts in his tragic life and ascension as a god, his great courage and rage, etc.

### Trojan War

The most important episode in classical mythology, and marks the end of heroic age.

We have heroic accounts of sons of those who fought in Trojan War, but not grandchildren: the connections heroes had with gods had ended and the iron age had begun.
Greeks believed the fall of Troy happened in 1184BC, at the same time the Mycenaean civilization waned.

Over time the myths developed into a complex and timeline-confused system.

Including Wedding of Thetis (a river goddess whose son is prophesied to be greater than the father, for which Zeus married her off to a human), Eris of discord not being invited and feeling offended, tossed the golden apple for which Hera, Athena and Aphrodite vied, and Zeus left Paris to judge.

The family of Agamemnon and Menelaus (**tragic house of Atreus**) and the former's sacrifice of his daughter.

The sack of Troy, the fate of Ajax, Cassandra, Priam, Agamemnon, Menelaus and Troy after the war.

Homer did not mention these, but mentioned Aeneas and his prophesied escaped from Troy, which Virgil took note and claimed him as an ancestor of Romans.

### Tragic house of Atreus, one of kinslaying and incest

**Tantalus**, father of Pelops, who was served by Tantalus to the gods and revived.

**Pelops** later tricked father-in-law in chariot race to win his daughter's hand in marriage, causing the death of the father-in-law.

**Atreus and Thyestes** sons of Pelops (wife of the former betrayed him for the latter. Latter cheated in deciding kingship of Mycenae between the two, former took vengeance by exiling the latter and later inviting him back to a feast, during which he was served his children).

**Agamemnon** (sacrificed his own daughter), Menelaus and Aegisthus (fathered by Thyestes on his own daughter due to Oracle's prophecy his son by his own daughter would exact vengeance on Atreus. Killed Agamemnon, was killed by Oreste)

Moral sins are passed on from fathers to sons.

Story of **Oreste** son of Agamemnon is best told by **Aeschylus's Oresteia**, the only complete surviving tragic trilogy of ancient Greece.
The third act is the **trial of Oreste** for killing his mother who murdered his father, with Apollo defending, Furies persecuting, 12 citizens of Athens in jury, and Athena as judge. Athena casted the vital vote to acquit Oreste.

Oresteia in particular is written in 5th Century BC during Athens's transition from being ruled by the court of Areopagus to classical democracy.
The play might have wanted to remind the people the importance that the court still serves, in the judicial system as opposed to city politics.

### Greek Tragedies

**Format of Greek tragedy** is usually a tragic trilogy followed by a comedy, where the three episodes of the trilogy are connected via same events / characters, or the same theme. Performed during the festival of Dionysus.

The creativity freedom an author was given may be very different from those of today's playwrights: the theme / story is somewhat fixed and well known, but an author can add or twist particular details to serve his dramaturgy purposes.
E.g. in Oresteia, to justify matricide, Clytemnestra as opposed to Aegisthus is described as the killer of Agamemnon.

Commonly depicted tragedy involves a moral dillema that a character faces.
E.g. Oreste needs to avenge his father and he also must not hurt his mother, but his mother murdered his father. Or Agamemnon needs to lead his army across the sea to do Menelaus and his house justice, but to do that he must sacrifice his daughter to appease Artemis. 

Trying to evade fate but only falling in its traps instead was another common theme.
E.g., Oedipus fated to kill his father and marry his mother. Modern interpretation tends to focus on the struggle between fate and free will in Oedipus's story (or Freud's far-fetched theory of the same name), though the concept of free will might have been foreign to ancient Greeks, whose language did not have a word for it.

Amazons are a recurring encounter for heroes and the counter usually ends with heroes taming them (e.g. Heracles, Theseus), putting women in their proper place, as the patriarchal ancient Greek society saw it.

Medea is not an Amazon but another one of the dangerous, immoral yet attractive foreign woman figure, described as a witch from Colchis, married first to Jason (tore her own brother to bits to slow down his father's pursuit of them for the stolen golden fleece, and later poisons Jason's sons by her to hurt him) then to Aegis.

Inter-generational tension and anxiety about women sexuality are recurring themes in classical myths, in which males of the heavily patriarchal society is anxious about having heirs that are their own.
Ancient Greeks might have believed that babies are not blood relatives of mothers: father does the work by planting seeds in the mother, like how plants were grown.

### Influence on Romans and after

Romans largely took Greek myths for their own (and rhetoric, philosophy, or culture in general).

Julius Caesar traces his lineage to Aeneis thus to Aphrodite.
Virgil would claim Aeneis is the ancestor of the Roman people, without contradicting the myth that Romulus founded Rome the city 400 years after the fall of Troy.

Livy recounts the story of Romulus.
Vergil, Horace, Livy and Ovid are authors during Augustus's reign, which saw a golden age for Roman literature.
Ovid of these did not receive patronage of the emperor, due to his books on practical techniques of seduction being in conflict with the emperor's agenda to re-establish traditional morals and religion, punish extra marrital affairs, and encourage fertility.

Shakespeare's work is influenced by Ovid's Metamorphosis, often times quotes and allusions in the former traces to stories in Metamorphosis.
Ovid named his book Metamorphosis due to each story being related with turning from one form to another, though many stories barely reflect that.

### Norse mythology

Not classical per se, but rather a collection of stories from mostly Prose Edda. (Poetic Edda is a different piece that most likely traces back to similar origins.)

Odin Allfather, he who sacrificed himself to himself, hang off of Yggdrasil the world tree, and discovered runes.
Sacrificed one eye for wisdom to his uncle, Mimir the guardian of wisdom.
Odin is wisest of all gods, and commonly associated with two ravens thought and memory, his arm ring Draupnir that reproduces itself, and his spear Gungnir, oaths sworn on which are deemed sacred.
Odin's hall Valhalla would host the worthy dead warriors, the einherjar, who are brought by the valkyrie to Valhalla to drink and feast and battle all day, and to follow Odin to the battleground of Ragnarok.

Loki is the child of giants and Odin's blood brother. Mischievous, dangerous and master of plots and schemes. The gods turn to him when something goes wrong, or they need to solve problems.

Frigg wife of Odin, mother of Balder and Hod, stepmother to Thor, Heimdall, Tyr, Bragi, Vidar, Vali.

Thor the thunder god and mightiest of Aesir. His belt Megingjörð gives him power, and he wields Mjölnir, a one-handed hammer that shrinks and enlarges, always hits its foe after being tossed, and comes back.

Men were made by Odin and his brothers from ash and elm trees (ask and embla), men and women respectively.

The nine worlds of Yggdrasil are connected by its root, including realm of men, jotunn, gods, light elves, helheim, etc.

Jötunn which some translates to giants are beings no less powerful than Aesirs themselves.
Notable ones include Skaði wife of Njord of Vanir, the stranger and his horse Svaðilfari who built the wall of Asgard and was deceived by the gods, mother of Fenrir, Jörmungandr and Hel by Loki, etc.

Mjölnir was gifted to Thor by the dwarf brothers Brokkr and Eitri.
The events were triggered by Loki stealing Thor's wife, Sif's hair.
A contest is then held between the brothers and the sons of Ivaldi to produce the most magnificent gifts to the gods, including Gullinbursti the golden boar and Skíðblaðnir the foldable and always fair wind ship for Frey, Mjölnir and Sif's golden hair for Thor, and Gungnir and Draupnir for Odin.

Loki fathered Hel, Jörmungandr and Fenrir with the giantess Angrboða. Hel whose face was half living, half dead; Jörmungandr the venomous midgard serpent, and Fenrir the evergrowing and hungry wolf.
The gods traveled to Jötunheimr to bring the ones prophecied for the doom of the gods back. Jörmungandr is tossed into the ocean, Hel sent to the realm of the dead who did not ascend to Valhalla, and Fenrir bound by the silk-like chains Gleipnir made by dwarves from bird's spittle, mountain's root, fish's breath, women's beard, bear's sinews and sound of cat's footfall, hence these items can no longer be found in our world.
Odin and the gods promised Fenrir that they are testing the chain on him and would release him if he's unable to break free, and as a sign of good faith the war god Tyr put his hand in Fenrir. Fenrir was deceived and bit off Tyr's right hand.

Mead of poetry was produced from the blood of Kvasir.
Kvasir was created by the gods from the spits of Aesirs and Vanirs after a truce between both. Kvasir knows and can answer everything.
In his travels evil dwarf brothers murdered him and brewed mead from his blood. The mead was later held by a giant, and Odin stole mead for the gods from his daughter.

The events of Ragnarok were set forth with the death of the fair Balder.
Balder saw himself in Hel's realm in his dreams. His mother asked everything in the world, plant, metals, and living creatures to swear to not harm Balder. They did, and spears tossed at Balder would deflect, and disease would avoid Balder.
She asked all except mistletoe, deemed too insignificant.
Loki learnt of this, and brewed poison from mistletoe.
The gods were having fun tossing weapons at Balder seeing them deflected, Hod the blind god and Balder's brother missed the fun. Loki instructed him to shoot Balder with arrow dipped in mistletoe poison, and Balder died.

Hel agreed to release Balder if all beings in the living world want him back, and Loki disguised as an old woman was the only one who said no.

Loki taunted the gods at the autumn feast, and was later captured by the fishnet he invented, when disguised as a salmon. He was bound by the entrails of his son with his wife Sigyn, and Skaði placed a serpent atop him.
Sigyn would hold a bowl above his head and catch the venom dripping from the serpent. When Sigyn moved away to empty the bowl, Loki would wriggle from the pain of venom dripping on his body, and the earth would shake.

Ragnarok is heralded by Fimbulwinter, a winter longer and colder than any.
During which Fenrir would escape his bound, as will Loki. Loki would lead legions of Hel atop the ship Naglfar, made from fingernails of the dead, and with the frost giant Hrym and the fire giant Surtr, battle the Aesirs and the einherjar led by Odin.
Odin will be devoured by Fenrir. Vidar Odin's son would split Fenrir's jaw and killing him.
Frey will fall to Surtr's flaming sword, Thor would kill Jörmungandr and die from its venom, Tyr and the hound Garm will kill each other, as will Heimdall and Loki.

Balder and Hod would return from Hel, Vidar and Vali Odin's sons will live, as will Thor's sons Magni and Modi.
A man and woman, life and life's desire, hiding in Yggdrasil, would also survive and become the ancestors of mankind, and a new age would begin.
