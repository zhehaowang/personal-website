# Bloomberg by Bloomberg - memorable quotes

_"The more you work, the better you do. It’s that simple."_

_"The more you try to do, the more life you’ll have."_

_"Life, I’ve found, works the following way: daily, you are presented with many small and surprising opportunities. Sometimes you seize one that takes you to the top. Most, though, if valuable at all, take you only a little way. To succeed, you must string together many small incremental advances - rather than count on hitting the lottery jackpot once."_

_"Constantly enhance your skills, put in as many hours as possible, and make tactical plans for the next few steps. Then, based on what actually occurs, look one more move ahead and adjust the plan. Take lots of chances, and make lots of individual, spur-of-the-moment decisions."_

_"Planning has its place; the actual thought process sometimes leads to great new ideas. But you can only accomplish what’s possible when you get there."_

_"Stay flexible, often what we accomplished isn’t what we set out to do."_

_"Then, whatever your idea is, you’ve got to do more of it than anyone else - a task that is easier if you structure your things such that you like doing them."_

_"Start with a small piece, fulfill one goal at a time, on time. Do it with all things in life. Sit down and learn one-syllable words. You can’t jump to the end right away, in computers, politics, love, or any other aspects of life."_

_"Outsiders do only what’s asked at best, insiders do what’s needed."_

_"While you are writing this, "they" are out to get us."_

_"In life, unlike in children’s games, second place is first loser."_

_"We simply throw everyone interested into the deep end of the pool as it were, and stand back. It becomes obvious very quickly who the best “swimmers” are. We just watch who people go to for help and advice."_

_"If you really want to do it, there is a way."_

_"I long ago declared that we would never rehire anyone who quit for other than family reasons."_

_"Be honest, work hard, treat each other fairly and openly. Add a dash of competence, and we’ll be together for a long time."_

_"Any supplier who offers today what it sold yesterday will be out of business tomorrow."_

_"Thinking and interpersonal skills have been, are, and will be keys to survival."_

_"Life’s a compromise. Will the satisfaction derived outweigh the sacrifices required? Of course. I never look back."_

_"Do things now while you have the time, so you don’t have to later when you are rushed."_

_"Consistency in thought and conduct. Think. Prepare. Plan in advance when there’s no time pressure. Then, in real life, do what you said."_

_"Three things usually separate the winners from the losers over the long term, time invested, interpersonal skills, and plain old fashioned luck."_

_"The rewards almost always go to those who outwork the others. You’ve got to come in early, stay late, lunch at your desk, take projects home and weekends. If you put in the time, you aren’t guaranteed success. But if you don’t, I’m reasonably sure of the results."_
