# 2018

December 23. Hudson River Trading Library, Floor 58, 4 World Trade Center.


2018 has been an eventful year. Leaving much to be pondered and appreciated.

### Three visits to Chicago

As we wandered by the snow-covered shores of Lake Michigan in January, I wouldn't have known two more trips to the same city awaits me a mere few months away.

Clouded by a sense of crisis and self doubts, there was a month when I said yes to every recruiter who reached out.
7 interviews were scheduled, 5 of which on-site.
And by the grace of Fortuna, 5 offers ensued.

Some from companies that I knew little about but gradually came to appreciate: IMC, Akuna in Chicago, and Zoox in Silicon Valley.
Others perhaps beyond my dreams, Google and Hudson River Trading.
In the last of which I currently sit, on the last Sunday night before Christmas.

I rarely thought myself a strong candidate, having less than 300 leetcode questions under my belt.

### Paseo de la Reforma

It now seems laughable how I frantically checked for updates from Google on the way back from Teotihuacan to Ciudad de Mexico.
Pacing restlessly up and down Paseo de la Reforma looking for a quiet spot to answer the call, and desparately trying to take in all the details knowing that I have made the cut.

The trip left fond memories.
My foolhardy attempt of pointing a phone at the stormy skies to capture the weapon of Zeus, and enjoying a hearty meal under the calm morning sun on the following day.

### Osiris

Two weeks later I cleared an entire day of interviews in Four World Trade Center.
In Room Osiris overlooking the Statue of Liberty, where in between the rounds I had the leisure of taking in panoramic views of the Hudson River glistening in dazzling summer sun.
Why they named the room after the Egyptian deity was beyond me, but a fitting name nonetheless: him of rebirth, and of Nile inundation hence of life and harvest.

Arguably I find	it hard to judge if I'm worthy of such.

Prudence often advised against judging, especially when not knowing the complete picture or being able to assess the variance in the most minute details.
Worthy or not, I am grateful for everything I was gifted with, and remained willing to commit my passion and efforts into what is deemed right.

May our path stays guided by prudence, and such willingness last.

### 2.2%

Vain and jealous as it may sound, the 2.2% was my last straw.
