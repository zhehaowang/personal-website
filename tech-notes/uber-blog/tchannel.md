# TChannel

### Problems

* Service discovery -- how do I discover and consume the services around me?
* Fault tolerance -- how can I best insulate myself from failures outside of my control?
* Dapper-style tracing -- how can I identify and monitor bottlenecks across the entire system?

### Description

* Request response
* On top of TCP

* Initiation: TCP handshake, version negotiation
