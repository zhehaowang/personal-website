# The Creative Habit -- Twyla Tharp

**Being creative is a full-time job with its daily patterns.**

More than anything, this book is about **preparation**: in order to be creative you have to know how to prepare to be creative.

If art is a bridge between what you see in your mind and what the world sees, skill is how you build that bridge.

* Establish **rituals** for preparation: automatic but decisive patterns of behavior, at the beginning of the creative process. Build yourself an environment that's habit forming.

Everyday you don't practice you are one day further from being good.

Give me a week without XXX (wechat / instagram / email / texts).

* Identify **your creative DNA**. Are you excited by creating something at a macro scale or micro scale? The general (zoe) or the specifics (bios)?

* Harness your **memory**. Metaphor is the life blood of all art, as it transforms something strange into something familiar. If all art is metaphor, then all art begins with memory.

* Before you think out of the box, start with a box: **an organizational system** that helps consolidate your work and ideas.

* **Scratching**: the first steps of a creative act are like groping in the dark, random and chaotic, feverish and fearful.

Scratch for ideas through reading, everyday conversation, people's handiwork, mentors and heroes, and nature.

Ideas can be acted upon in four ways,
* generate the idea: from memories or experience or activities
* retain it in your memory or your box
* inspect it, to study it and make inferences
* transform it, alter it in some way to suit your higher purpose

Be in shape. Scratching takes longer when you are not.
Scratch in the best places.
Don't scratch the same place twice.
Maintain the white hot pitch.

* **Be prepared for accidents**. They will happen. Have a plan in mind when you get down to work, but also know what to do if that plan falls apart. Meanwhile, there is a fine line between planning and overplanning: **you never want planning to inhibit the natural evolution of your work**.

* Identify the **spine** of your work: the first strong idea as you scratch, then develop it into the spine of your work.

* **Skill** gives you the wherewithal to execute whatever occurs to you. Without it, you are just a font of unfulfilled ideas. **You are only kidding yourself if you put creativity before craft**. Take an inventory of your skills, try taking one away, would you still be able to create?

* Ruts and grooves. They happen. There will come a time when your creativity fails (a rut): you stare at the screen but it refuses to meet your eyes. You spin your wheels, it spits out mud and splatters other people, but it doesn't go anywhere. You get the feeling the world is moving on but you are standing still. It could be the consequence of a bad idea, bad timing, bad luck, etc.

To get out of a rut, identify and admit the rut first, then act on it: see what's not working, write down your assumptions about it, challenge your assumptions, and act on the challenge.

A groove is a golden age in your creation. 

* Failures. They happen. No matter who you are, at some point you will present your work to the outside world, and the world will find it wanting. Patrons shrug, critics hiss, audiences stay away in droves, and even closest friends avert their eyes. Incredibly, there is good news here. Sometimes you will fail, but the world will give you a second chance to get it right.
Admit your failure and adapt. You do your best work after your biggest disasters.

* The long run. **It takes time to master an art. Think, act, rinse and repeat**.

Your best work may come from a creativity "bubble", where you eliminate distractions, sacrifice pleasures, and place yourself in a single-minded isolated chamber where all your efforts feed to the work.
**Create, eat, sleep, exercise and solitude**.

Being in the bubble doesn't mean exciling yourself from the outside world. We have families, jobs, responsibilities that impinge on our desire to create. At its worst, the bubble conjures up an image of the artist toiling away in his studio, ignoring the cries of his children and sacrifices his wife makes so that he can concentrate on his work. I don't find that a heroic image.
**Maintain a balance**. Sooner or later you'll have to come out of the bubble, and when you do, it'd be nice if there were loved ones to greet you.
