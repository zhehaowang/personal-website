# Language

Language is not the same as communication / imitation (the latter animals can do but the former seems unique to homo sapiens).

A gradual evolution 100k years ago.

Chomsky hypothesis: language is something we are genetically programmed with, as opposed to culture, society-specific phenomenon.
As speaking a language is not particular to certain areas but all humans do.
Also the ability to learn new languages degrade as one gets older, another characteristic of something a species is genetically programmed to do.

There are over 6000 spoken languages and over 200 written. A language can have only three verbs where they say "do a sleep"; it may use clicks (Bantu languages of Botswana and Namibia, X, C, Q pronounced with a tongue click) where having one to four clicks before a word mean different things; it may have one word that others mean in a long sentence.

### Language change over time

The writing changes slower, and the sound changes happen faster, typically in following ways:
* Assimilation, least effort to make the different sounds. Example being inpossibilis in Latin to impossibilis, as m is closer to the following p. 
* Consonant devolve: they become softer or omitted over time. Examples being Latin into French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian. The change of t and d, k and g, removal of consonant sound, etc. aqua (Latin) --> agua (Spanish) --> eau (French).
* Vowel devolve and shift over time.
The Great Vowel Shift, starting in the 13th Century, the vowels shifted "up". ah --> ay. name as nahmeh to its modern day pronouciation is a result of this shift, and devolve the last vowel.
Modern written English still reflects how the language was pronounced before the shift: oo as in food was a long ou but now an u, feed was an ae but now i.

The language we speak today also shifts, e.g. aw --> ah in some areas. They started out as accents and gradually the general populace talk in different ways.
Meaning of words, too, shift: awesome and lame in the 60s vs now.

With the sounds devolving over time a language does not become fumbling of vowels over time, as new words are constantly being created.

Some languages work with tones, others suffixes prefixes.
Tones presumably could have come from words devolved over time. Imagine "pa", "pas", "pak" meaning different things in a language, over time the consonant devolves and the only thing differentiating these would be tone.

Grammatical words and concrete words

**Grammaticalization**: over time concrete ones devolve into grammatical ones. Example being the French pas, where it used to be that ne by itself means negation, and pas had a concrete meaning of "a step", like il ne marche pas used to mean he doesn't walk a step. Over time this concrete meaning devolved and pas was appended meaning general negation with ne.
ne can be downplayed in Spoken French, imagine someone else transcribing this language they can derive the impression that pas alone means negation.

Suffixes and prefixes, and tones, too, are results of grammaticalization. Latin has different verb forms for "I speak", "you speak" and "he speaks", which is resulted from the phrase "speak I will", etc, and the I/you/he will parts were different. They were glossed over over time and the verb "speak" with different suffixes became prevalent.

Another language is "will" used to come from "sun come", in an African language.

**Rebracketing** is another common sound change, where the boundary of two words became different. "My Ellie" turned into "Nelly", "My Edward" turned into "Ned", "all one" turned into alone.

### Semantic change

Meaning change over time, too. Silly used to mean blessed, and the German root still means blessed. Silly Virgin Mary means blessed / innocent Virgin Mary in the 13th Century. Gradually it shifted to mean innocent in Shakespeare's time. Innocent is connected with needing some compassion and in our time it means not very bright. Nice use to mean fine-grained small pieces, as in nicety, but has to mean pleasant in our time.

In this way, bear (to carry a burden) shares the same root as birth (th is grammaticalization of another word, like warmth for warm), and transfer / prefer (borrowed from Latin's proto-Indo-European root of bear, fer).

Semantic narrow and widen, too. Meat used to mean all food but has specifically come to mean animal flesh. Bird used to be specific and foul was general but now the semantic of bird is widened.

### Word order change

* Modern languages have all combinations of (subject, verb, object) order.
* Both SOV and SVO are very common, historically change from SOV to SVO has been common, while the other direction has been rare.
  * Modern German, Turkish, old English, biblical Hebrew are all SOV languages, while modern English and modern Hebrew are SVO.
  * Welsh, Irish Gaelic, Polynesian languages are VSO.
  * OVS is rare, some South American native language uses it.
  * An Australian native language has no fixed order. Suffix and context differentiate subject and object.
* Language studies words, sounds, grammar and meaning change over time.

### Change

Language is constantly morphing, not for good or bad.
Some directions of change are predictable: e.g. th in English to t, f, or s.
Some semantic decay can be seen in lie/lay, infer/imply, hither/thither/whither, thou look'st/thee look, is shot/shotten, spit/spitten in modern English.
Earlier pronounciation books (recorded sound became available only in the 1870s) suggested dismay/dismiss should be pronounced dizmay/dizmiss, and balcony has emphasis on co.
Modern English says "a house is being built" while 19c English may say "a house is building"

Example of change in Latin, of the Indo-European Italic language and the origin of Romance languages.
The Roman Empire is unique in its efforts of Romanization: ancient empires, e.g. that of the Persians rarely impose that their language be the only language taught in conquered territory.

Latin uses noun suffixes to indicate object, and doesn't have to, a, the, etc. Modern Romance languages dropped these noun suffixes. 

Some common pattern of change, e.g. grass in Latin, herba, h is usually fragile in Romance language, French herbe, Spanish hierba (pronounced yierba), Italian erba, Portuguese relva, Romanian iarba.

English is proto-Germanic and has undergone lots of changes, too. Shakespeare writes in a language that is very different from what is spoken today.
Due to semantic drifts, Shakespeare translated to modern foreign languages can often be easier to understand.
E.g. wherefore meant why, not where; wit meant knowledge, not as in witticism. (humor is fragile!)

Jane Austen's language is also different from ours, e.g. "you are come at last", or "it would, would not it?" is perfectly normal in her time.

Archaic Chinese evolved as well, several branches of modern Chinese can sound like completely different languages: a few major variations in mandarin, cantonese, shangainese, fujianese, taiwanese, gan, xiang, hakka language (ke'jia'hua)

In English, present progress tense vs present habitual tense is pretty unique / nice: the "-ing" form of a verb like "I am eating" is not present in languages like French or German.

### Proto-Indo-European

Studies showed the similarity between Sanskrit, Latin and ancient Greek, non of these spoken now.
They trace back to the same ancestor, a proto-Indo-European language which is the ancestor of most languages in Europe (except Hungarian, Basque, Finnish, and a few others), Iran, and upper two-thirds of India (lower third was Dravidian language family).

This was not a written language, and its original forms can be deduced from variations in today's descendant languages (sound, and more so in grammar).

Proto-Indo-European is thought of to have started from Kurgan language of southern Russian steppes (others may claim Anatolia / Turkey), as genetic traces would suggest, as well as certain patterns and living descendants of this language tend to have common words for horse, wheels, but not oak, vine, or palm trees.

German, English (and Swedish, Norwegian, Danish) are Germanic branches of Indo-European, where from Latin some common deviations include p --> f (pater to father), t --> th, etc. This is described in Grimm's Law.

Latvian and Lithuanian, the Baltic branch of Indo-European, is thought to have undergone more conservative changes, and remain closer to the Indo-European root. (More so in Slavic languages, too)

Armenian and Albanian, although Indo-European in origin, have borrowed more from neighboring languages and fewer words in common with the other branches of Indo-European languages.

Comparative reconstruction: decuding the original form of a proto-Indo-European word from several modern day / extinct descendants.
The general methodology seems to combine the more uncommon features from later variants (some common forms of decay / patterns of change have been noted), as those, especially if appearing in multiple descendants in different geolocations, are more unlikely to be the results of coincidental change the multiple descendants all went through.

### Some peculiarities 

Semitic languages (of Afro-Asiatic language family, Hebrew, Arabic, Ethiopian, etc). Tri-consonantal root with vowel variations

Japanese, Southeast Asian languages, Chinese, numeral classifier, sounds like la ba me to help convey meaning, no distinction between he, she, it in sound, and generally more contextual than English.

### Tracing language families

Tracing the source of a language family: usually the area with the largest diversity, Austronesian languages, spoken east of Australia, Polynesian, Indonesia, Malaysia and Madagascar (!) is thus thought to have originated from Taiwan, as three of the four sub families in Austronesian have their presence in Taiwan.

Similarly, Bantu languages (Swahili, Xhosa, etc) spoken south of the Sahara are thought to have started from Cameroon and east Nigeria.

Khoisan languages (click languages) spoken in southwestern Africa may have been the descendent of the first human language, as its families are very diverse, and the raison d'etre of some features like clicks would otherwise be hard to deduce.

Native American languages are extremely diverse in regions like California and further south but not in Alaska, even though Archaeological evidence points to native Americans having migrated across the Bering Strait.
This correlates with climate change in that native Alaskans languages are those spoken by the people from down south who repopulated that area, after the ice age.
