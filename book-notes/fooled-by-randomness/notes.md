# Fooled by randomness

Luck is often mistaken for skills, probability mistaken for certainty.

Croesus wanted to impress Solon with his fortune, and asked Solon who the happiest man is.
Solon suggested one who lived a noble life and died in battle. Reason being.

"You asked me a question concerning a condition of humankind â€” happiness. I reckon 70 years to be a long life. Of those 26,250 days, no two will be the same. We are wholly accident. Good fortune is always mixed with misery. In the journey of our lives there is an infinity of twists and turns, and the weather can change from calm to whirlwind in an instant. We can never know what might come next. The gods are jealous and like to mess with mortals. Sometimes we get a glimpse of happiness, and then are plunged into ruin. Yes you are fortunate, wonderfully rich, lord of many peoples. But with respect to the question you asked, I have no answer, until I hear that you have closed your life happily."

Monte carlo, random process, alternate history. "Why me"?

It is not natural for us to learn from history.

Hindsight bias.
