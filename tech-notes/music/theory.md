### musical distance

```
... C    D    E F    G    A    B C (one octave) ...
```

Chromatic scale, equivalent in sharps and flats
```
... C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C (sharps)     ... 
... C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B C (flats)      ... 
```

### Scale

E.g. A (starting note) Major (pattern)

The major pattern goes as, whereas W means whole step, and H means half step
```
    W    W    H W    W    W    H
```
mapping onto the starting note of A, we have
```
    A    B    C# D   E    F#   G#   A  (A major)
```

Another example

F Major
```
F   G    A A#   C    D    E    F  (F major)
F   G    A Bb   C    D    E    F
```

Minor
```
    W    H W    W    H W    W
```

A minor
```
    A    B C    D    E F    G
```

### Scale degrees

The note you start on is 1. The rest fall in line.

Harmonic minor: sharpen the 7.
```
    A    B C    D    E F    G    A  (A natural minor, no sharps or flats)
    A    B C    D    E F    G#   A  (A harmonic minor)
```

Melodic minor: sharpen the 6 and 7 on the way up. Natural on the way down.

### Intervals

Measurement of musical distance.

Major, Minor, Perfect, 
* M2 (major second, one whole step. In C Major, between 1st and 2nd, C --> D.)
* m2 (minor second, one half step. Note this does not map to the chromatic scale of a minor)
* M3 (major third, two whole steps. In C Major, between 1st and 3rd, C --> D.)
* m3 (minor third, one whole step, one half step. In C Minor, between 1st and 3rd, C --> Eb.)
* P4 (perfect fourth, C --> F, in both major and minor scales.)
* P5 (perfect fifth, C --> G, in both major and minor scales.)
* M6 (major sixth, C --> A in major scale.)
* m6 (minor sixth, C --> Ab in minor scale.)
* M7 (major seventh, C --> B in major scale.)
* m7 (minor seventh, C --> Bb in minor scale.)

So, mapping to a chromatic scale starting at C, we have for each half step
* m2 (C --> Db)
* M2 (C --> D)
* m3 (C --> Eb)
* M3 (C --> E)
* P4 (C --> F)
* Tritone (C --> Gb)
* P5 (C --> G)
* m6 (C --> Ab)
* M6 (C --> A)
* m7 (C --> Bb)
* M7 (C --> B)
* Octave (C --> C)

Each major and minor scales starting on the same note will have their M2, P4, P5 and the octave in common.

Diminished, Augmented
* C --> E, major third
* C --> Eb, minor third (dropped by a half major)
* C --> E# (not F), augmented third (raised by a half from major)
* C --> Ebb (not D), diminished third (dropped by another half from major)

* C --> G, perfect fifth
* C --> Gb, diminished fifth (dropped by a half from perfect)
* C --> C#, augmented fifth (raised by a half from perfect)

### Melody

A single line of music.
Say we choose F major, our 1 will be F, 2 will be G, etc.
```
F   G    A Bb   C    D    E    F
```
A melody in F major can be
```
1  4  4  3  5  1
F  Bb Bb A  C  F
```
The same melody in other scales will be
```
1  4  4  3  5  1
C  F  F  E  G  C  (C major)
A  D  D  C  E  A  (A minor)
```

A harmony is a set of melodies played at the same time.

### Chords

Triad chord: start from the root note of the scale and pick every other note until you have 3. Play the three at the same time.
E.g.
```
A major triad: A  C# E
A minor triad: A  C  E (lower the middle note by a half step, to make a major triad a minor triad)
```

### Chord progression

Chords can be named I, ii as well, where I denote the root note.
E.g. we are building off of A major
```
Chord I  is A  C# E
Chord ii is B  D  F#
Chord IV is D  F  A (second octave)
```
Notice ii is a **minor chord** while I and IV are **major chords** as ii has the middle note being half a step closer to the root note in terms of musical distance.

In all major scales, chords major and minor goes as I ii   iii IV V vi vii-d(iminished).
In all minor scales, chords major and minor goes as i ii-d III iv v VI VII.

### The tritone

Tritone: one --> augmented fourth / diminished fifth. (E.g. C --> F# in C Major).
Alternatively, take any note and go up three whole steps. Hence tritone.
A tritone can resolve by having the root note and end note move towards each other each by a half step, or away from each other each by a half step.

Tritone is symmetrical: each octave has two tritones of the same distance.
