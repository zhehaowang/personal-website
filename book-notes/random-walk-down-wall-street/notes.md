# Part I: stocks and their valuation

### Firm foundation theory, intrinsic value

Stock valuation depends on the estimations of earning power of the company many years in the future.
(PV of cashflows a company is able to earn in the future for its investors)

### Castle-in-the-air theory, mass psycology

Styles and fashions in investors’ evaluations of securities can and often do play a critical role in the pricing of securities.
The stock market at times conforms well to the castle-in-the-air theory.
For this reason, the game of investing can be extremely dangerous.

Another lesson that cries out for attention is that investors should be very wary of purchasing today’s hot "new issue.
Most initial public offerings underperform the stock market as a whole.
And if you buy the new issue after it begins trading, usually at a higher price, you are even more certain to lose.
Investors would be well advised to treat new issues with a healthy dose of skepticism.
Certainly investors in the past have built many castles in the air with IPOs.
Remember that the major sellers of the stock of IPOs are the managers of the companies themselves.
They try to time their sales to coincide with a peak in the prosperity of their companies or with the height of investor enthusiasm for some current fad. In such cases, the urge to get on the bandwagon—even in high-growth industries—produced a profitless prosperity for investors.

Res tantum valet quantum vendi potest. (A thing is worth only what someone else will pay for it.)

### Dutch tulips bubble

**How futures contract made money**

The market engineers complex contracts to serve those seeking capital or investment outlets (or investors trying hard to part with their money).

### The tronics, biotech, and dotcom bubble

**Concept stocks**
The issues of a company with few or no earnings but a good story to tell and great potential.
Speculative and risky.

**How merger creates illusion of growth**


### The housing bubble

##### Mortgage backed security

For banks handing out mortgages, instead of the originate and hold system 30 years ago, it's now originate and distribute: mortgage loans were originated by the banks, who only holds them for a few days, until they could be sold to an investment banker.
The investment banker would then assemble packages of these mortgages and issue mortgage backed securities, derivative bonds "securitized" by the underlying mortgages.
These collateralized securities relied on the payments of interest and principal from the underlying mortgages to esrvice the interest payment on the new mortgage-backed bonds that were issued.
Making matters more complicated, there are multiple bonds issued against a package of mortgages.
Different tranches with different claim priorities.

Same goes for credit card loans and automobile loans.

##### Credit default swaps

Second-order derivatives such as CDS were sold on the mortgage-backed bonds.
CDS were sold as insurance policy on the mortgage-backed bonds, where one party would pay the other, in order to be paid back, in case of a default of the particular bond.

CDS traded in the market can be 10 times the value of the underlying, making today's financial system very much riskier and interconnected.

CDS being unregulated, and the mortgage originator facing a smaller risk (they only hold it for a few days before passing it on), led to looser and looser borrowing standards.
Increasingly, lenders did not even bother to ask for documentation about ability to pay.
Money for housing was freely available, and housing prices rose rapidly.

##### How it happened

Loosening borrowing standard made borrowing for housing easier. 

The government itself played an active role: its regulations required loans be easily available, to low-income borrowers.

Housing price in turn inflated due to buyers having easy access to capital, beyond their value.
(The inflation in housing prices encouraged more loans to be taken to be invested in buying houses, further jacking up housing prices. The positive loop in building up a bubble.)

Eventually mortgages buyers took became far more valuable than the house, and some buyers defaulted, returning the keys and causing the lenders to hold these toxic properties without a demand.
(The loop reversed in bursting a bubble.)

### Are the markets efficient

Markets can occasionally be irrational, but eventually it corrects itself: true value is recognized, and this is the main lesson investors must heed.

And true value, as stated in firm foundation theory, depends on the estimations of earning power of the company many years in the future.

The estimation cannot be accurately made, and market prices must always be wrong to some extent.
And even professional investors cannot estimate well enough to always hold the undervalued stocks and sell the overvalued ones.

### Technical analysis

Investment by castle-in-the-air theory.

Chartists.
Think a stock chart (line with a bar on y-axis for each point on x-axis) where it marks daily high, low, closing prices and volumes traded.

Make decisions based on patterns in the chart (e.g. head-and-shoulders), and ignore factors like income statement, balance sheet, etc. 

##### Does it really work

The history of stock price movements contains no useful information that will enable an investor consistently to out-perform a buy-and-hold strategy in managing a portfolio.

In other words, you are unlikely to beat buying index funds by staring at charts.

The claim is that stock price movement (in the short term) is a random process (hence the name, random walk).

Technical methods cannot be used to make useful investment strategies, and not one has consistently outperformed the simple buy-and-hold, with fees and taxes in mind.
This is the foundamental conclusion of the random walk theory.
Stock prices cannot be predicted on the basis of past stock prices.

### Fundamentals analysis

Investment by firm foundation theory.

Rules (of pricing a stock): a rational investor is willing to pay more if (given the same conditions otherwise)
* growth rate of dividends and earnings are higher
* a larger proportion of a company's earning is paid out in cash dividends or to buy back stock
* risk is lower (e.g. volatility as a measurement)
* interest rate is lower

Future growth, risk, interest rate cannot be determined (or deterministically) inferred from present.
Thus the precise price cannot be determined. (and pricing becomes a matter of assumptions and scenarios.)

When comparing different aspects above of two companies and deciding if one's price is undervalued, it's useful to compare ***price / earning ratio** (P/E ratio, price per share divided by earnings per share).
With one company's P/E ratio as a benchmark, compare the above aspects to decide if another company's P/E ratio is higher or lower than expected.

##### Does it really work

Very few active fund managers outperform the market consistently.

Security analysis, or predicting the future, is fundamentally difficult due to random events, company "creative" accounting, mistakes of analysts, losing analysts to sales or portfolio managers, and conflict of interest between analysts and investment banking department.

With these, we introduce the **efficient market hypothesis**.
* The weak form suggests technical analysis - looking at past price patterns, cannot help investors.
* The semi-strong form suggests looking at public information (fundamental analysis) cannot help investors, either, due to the market being efficient, and stock pricing has already taken into account all the public information available.
* The strong form suggests even having insider information (fundamental analysis, but against the law) doesn't help, nothing helps. This tends to be an overstatement.

### View on HFT

HFT does not hurt individual investors.
Technology has always facilitated trading.

One way they can help is in pricing of ETFs: any discrepancy between the pricing of an ETF with its underlying stocks will quickly be arbitraged away, thus improving liquidity, better prices, and making the market more efficient.

That said, it would be illegal if optimally positioned traders can see the orders of others, and drive prices up or down before such orders are executed.
This kind of insider trading, called "front-running", is regulated by SEC.

### Combining fundamental and technical

* Buy only companies that are expected to have above-average earnings growth for five or more years (double the factor, price grows and P/E ratio grows)
* Never pay more for a stock than its firm foundation of value
* Look for stories whose stories of anticipated growth are of the kind on which investors can build castles in the air

Simply buying and holding a diversified portfolio suited to your objectives will enable you to save on investment expense, brokerage charges and taxes.

Over the past 30 years, 95 percent of stock market gains came from 1% of the total amount of trading days.

### Modern portfolio theory

(Given an efficient market) risk, and risk alone, determines the degree to which returns will be above or below average.

Risk can be measured as the standard deviation (volatility) of price (a random variable).

**Modern portfolio theory** shows how to combine diversified instruments to give the least risk possible with the return investors seek.

It's possible to reduce risk by diversification, as long as the individual instruments are not completely positively correlated.
Due to the possible negative correlation between different instruments and different currencies / economies, it's possible to obtain lower volatility and higher rate of return (to a certain degree) at the same time by diversification.

Globalization increases the correlation of instruments, especially in times of financial crisis.
