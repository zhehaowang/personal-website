# On Habits

### Bookkeeping

Often enough we found ourselves not being able to pick up notes or research results done longer than a few months ago.

To ease future lookup and improve future efficiency, we should follow certain bookkeeping conventions.

Work logs, research results, profiling outcome, historical binaries should go into designated location on a shared drive (or public git with personal projects), with folder names indicating subject and style of work done, each folder should have a readme.md, recording
* what this is and why.
* what we tried, the current status.
* results as well as comments on anything in the folder that is not immediately obvious. These should include failed experiments where we should also record why the idea is given up.
* what the conclusions are and current plan is

It seems good to also have one centralized and shared place to record overall status tracking and projects we wanted to take on, for at-work and personal ones.
The scale and time horizon of these nowadays appear big enough to justify a(nother, and hopefully last) formal bookkeeping attempt.

### Coding / design habits

A common theme we are seeing more often with personal work is having to rework things previously done, procrastinating too long in getting simple features in (e.g. meaningful logging using designated modules, division of components, meaningful argparse), or opting for brute force approach as opposed to setting tools up for longer term (e.g. consistent autoformatting).

Software architecture recommendation we received was to generally prioritize going well over going fast, and my past behavior also seemed to lean generally towards the latter.
Then as an overall principle, in personal projects I should
* consider spending more time on design, think and research more before you start writing
* knock out problems we consistently get confused about, follow known best practices and if something takes too much effort to follow, invest into ways of automation

(This echoes back to an earlier realization regarding what to do when encountering unfamiliar vocabulary in English literature. Finding a balance seems nontrivial yet the tendency of glossing over seemed to have harmed overall efficiency and quality in recent observations)

### Knowledge compaction / consolidation

It seems almost cliche that we often see ourselves repeatedly making similar realizations.

Completely forgetting and relearning something from scratch is fine, and often times would come with new and improved insight, but having to relearn too often, or having knowledge retained in memory for too short appeared to have hurt our overall effectiveness.

This appears to be a compounded effect of the following
* subpar bookkeeping, hoping to be better addressed in item1
* not understanding the subject matter well enough in the first place, hoping to be better balanced in item2
* not having an established compaction schedule. Historically we had issue-tracker implemented, but the habit was never formed and the strict curve in the first iteration appeared too much overhead to actually implement. Compaction often seems less cool than picking up new things, which makes it more critical for us to establish well thought-out procedures to carry them out.

### Day-to-day

Empirical observation would suggest most biggest factors in loss of efficiency are usually distractions, not wanting to start, and having not rested well enough.

It'd be useful to identify instances of each, and regulate our behavior in reasonable ways.
