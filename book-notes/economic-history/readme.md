### Before the 1400s

China and India were by far the largest economies in the world.

Advancements in Chinese agriculture led to urbanization, flourising land route and maritime trade.
Chinese invention of paper money, and advanced silk and metal industry (steel) contributed to this flourishing period.
Cities along the silk road, Basrah, Baghdad, Samarkand, etc were rich.

India had a cotton industry with cheap and expensive fabric, rice, salt, as well as spices exports.
While the economy of China or India are self sufficient, that of, e.g. Malacca are largely dependent upon Chinese and Indian exports.

After the Mongol invasion, the silk road became much safer for caravans to travel, bringing oriental products to Mameluke Egypt.
Genoa was its most important European trading partner then, and later on overtaken by Venice.

Contrary to popular belief, the economy of China or India was not isolationist or passive.

Meanwhile in Europe, manorialism (less accurately, feudalism) features land granted by tradition and not sold, and land is entrusted to nobles in charge of administration, dispensing justice, in exchange for their sesrvice in war.
Nobles and their serfs would live off of what the land produces, and there is no wage labor.

Under such a system there would be few public facilities.
Holdings are private in that ownership can more often be ascribed to one party, as opposed to a country.

European agricultural advancement in this time includes water / windmill, and heavy plough made available by horse collars' redesign. (Harness would no longer the choke the animal, and ploughing would previously use oxes, but now can use more powerful horses. This might have derived from Chinese invention as well.)
