# Random realizations, quotes from conversations with friends

Although we are young, and the cost of making sub-optimal choices is relatively small, but with each choice there still is a cost.
Now that I think of it, miss the chance to go to Tsinghua / CMU / Google / ... once, we probably miss it for life.
The impact magnifies through time, leading one down different paths in life...maybe diverging farther from the goal we set out to achieve, if there ever was one.
At some point one settles down, becomes satisfied and loses the mettle.
When that day comes and I think back, I just want to reassure myself I did everything I could, and worked hard for everything I believed right.

At a game, as well as at other things: a big difference is whether there is a purpose in mind.
Today Iâ€™ve a goal to improve my skills.
What do I want to learn and internalize today? How do I achieve that? Did I manage to achieve it?

There were times in games when I thought "why don't you noobs get good", then I realized it's just different life priorities.
Some play to have fun, some play to win.
I'm still in the middle of figuring out why I play, and along that process we found a few things that might make a difference.
Now is just as good a time as any to do those.

After a while the absurd becomes the norm: hour-long build times, non-existent coding convention, hidden undefined behaviors floating around, dependency loops, and the like.
The silent desperation takes over, and one starts to think it must be the same everywhere else, and not worth the trouble to seek a change.
This, too, unfortunately, is what comes with experience.
Zoom in, zoom out, don't lose sight of what we set out to achieve, and embrace changes.
On how we do things, and more importantly, on how I perceive them and take them on.

With travels there comes change, habits being uprooted and reformed.
We may fear losing the key initiatives / inspirations / insight we just had, or simply fear the unknown.
It is at such moments we should reiterate the deepest values we believed in, what we set out to achieve, stay confident in who we are, and seek opportunities within the changes.

The difference often comes from that final push, one that goes just beyond the critical mass, and tips the balance in your favor.
One can give up thinking the tasks all but impossible, or complain about the inability of others.
Yet know that more often than not failure comes one's own lackage of resolve to make the final push, or one's inexperience in seeing the merits and contributions of others.

Much like the time-value of money, using which we discount future cashflows to derive a present value, there is a time-value of knowledge / skills / achievements (meta-physically, all assets) as well.
Different branches of knowledge have instrinsically different discount curves, mapped to a multi-dimensional space of evaluation criteria.
Thus the key would lie in identifying the critical path, and giving it all you got, now.

You should know when to stop. And when you are about to, push one step further. You never know if just one step would make all the difference if you simply don't take it.

The biggest asset of a company, or perhaps any human construct, is its people.
Make sure they are treated as such, and make sure they are given the right environment and resources to inspire their potentials.

Looking at my documents since 2013 there are at least three dozen named notes, thoughts, realizations, plans and the like.
Most of them are scratches, mind dumps, and early studies that never led to fruition.
They strike me with the realization that almost none of my ideas now is completely new.
They all trace back to somewhere, although the source may seem long forgotten.
Work on your bookkeeping, taxonomy, and consolidate often.

Learn like you will not be able to tomorrow.
That may actually happen.

Do your best to learn from them, rather than be intimidated by them.

Reach out. Ask. Praise. Appreciate. Voice your thoughts.

Right, wrong, good, bad, it's all a matter of perspective.
Keep an open mind. Know and appreciate that your perspective may not be one shared by others.


* Maybe it's this particular feeling of having one's mind inspired that drew me close as it longed for food for thought. It almost reminds me an old friend and the way she used to kindle ideas from these ashes.
* Come to think of it, perhaps I was naive and biased while she was right all along. In hindsight, perhaps her choices were for the best, delivered in a very tactful manner.

* what I don't do well in
  * convey your thoughts in a confident and clear way. Some fear seems to have been holding us back.
  * I would think I'm not a cynic, not an inconsiderate person, not overly vain and not terrible at certain things, are those merely blissful illusions that the mind chose to weave for me?
  * When to settle for a compromise, and when to aim only for the very best, how we balance?

* Learn something new different every 30, 60, 90, 360 days? Improve in certain ways? Change, forming habits, a conscious influence, and a dedicated effort.

* This mind seems to have lost some of its most treasured liveliness / imagination / daringness / humor, could one blame it on the burden of real life? Did things really take a downturn since this job? What exactly is this burden? Immigration? Work? Future? Desire for a breakthrough? Routine? Is this something we should actively work to thwart?
