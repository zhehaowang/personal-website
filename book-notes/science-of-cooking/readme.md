# Science of cooking

### Elements of taste

* salty, to keep internal salt level balanced
* sweet, indicating easy to digest
* bitter, potentially harmful, danger alert
* sour, acids, source of vitamin C, or has gone bad
* umami, (鲜), protein indication
* fatty, indicating rich energy

### Maillard reaction

Chemical reaction starting at 140 C / 284 F between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its distinctive flavor. (fuse / new flavor and aromatic substances.)
Seared steaks, crispy fish skin, fried dumplings, cookies and other kinds of biscuits, breads, toasted marshmallows, and many other foods undergo this reaction.

Since this happens beyond boiling point of water, the surface moisture needs to be driven off by heat first.

Intensifies (twice as quickly) at 150 C / 302 F, peaks at 160 C / 320 F.

**Pyrolysis** (burning) starts at 180 C / 356 F, food chars and becomes bitter.
Carbs, proteins, and then fat breaks down, leaving harmful substance.

### Pairing

Each food has characteristic flavor compounds, the chemicals that lend it its aroma, pungency, and taste.

Shared flavor compounds can often serve as basis for pairing (roasted beef with onion / wheat / butter / beer / peanut butter / mushrooms / coffee).

However, the theories do not account for a food's texture and don't always hold true for Asian and Indian cuisines, where spice combinations have very few or no flavor links.

### Knives

Material
* carbon steel
* stainless steel (with chromium)
* ceramic

Collection
* Serrated knife (Foods that have a tough crust or smooth, delicate skin, such as bread, cake, or large tomatoes where precision isn’t required.)
* Chef's knife (Finely slicing, dicing, disjointing large cuts of meat, and crushing garlic cloves with the side of the blade.)
* Paring knife (Slicing, peeling, coring, and delicate work such as stripping out vanilla beans.)
* Carving knife (Making thin cuts of meat from a large cut.)

### Pots and pans

Material
* Stainless steel (conducts heat poorly, food sticks easily.)
* Copper (heavy and expensive, conducts heat well, reacts to acid and needs coating.)
* Aluminum (conducts heat quickly and loses heat quickly off stove, lightweight, has coating)
* Carbon steel (heats up faster than stainless, but reacts to acid and rusts.)
* Cast iron (Very heavy, cast iron is dense and heats slowly, but, once heated, it retains heat well and is ideal for browning meat in a skillet or casserole. Also reacts with acid so season it, coat with protective nonstick seal and clean carefully. Avoid abrasive cleaners.)

**Pan's thickness**: the thicker the base, the more evenly the heat from the burner spreads across it.

Collection
* Wok
  * Stir-frying over the hottest flame, steaming, and deep-fat frying.
  * A tight-fitting lid, a thin base, and long sturdy handle. Avoid nonstick, which won’t tolerate high stir-frying heats. Carbon steel is ideal; to season it, scrub off the existing oil coat, heat to blacken, add oil to smoke, then rub off the oil when cool. Do this 3–4 times before use.
* Cast-iron skillet
  * Root veg, meats, sticky foods (if seasoned), putting under the broiler and in the oven.
  * A long, heat-proof handle (cast iron retains heat) and a grip handle to aid in lifting.
* Round casserole dish
  * Slow-braising meats.
  * A tight-fitting lid and easy-to-grasp handles. Although heavy, cast iron is ideal because it keeps a steady temperature, and an enamel interior is durable and doesn’t react with acids.
* Saucepan
  * Sauces, stews, soups, stocks, boiling vegetables, rice, and pasta.
  * Lids to retain moisture, and an extra small-grip handle on large pans to aid in lifting. Heat-proof handles are oven-friendly.
* 10in / 24cm frying pan
  * Delicate fish, eggs, and crêpes.
  * A thick base and thick nonstick coat—choose from a reputable supplier.
* 12in / 30cm saute pan
  * Searing and frying large batches; creating sauces and large meals.
  * A tight-fitting lid to hold moisture, a long handle, and a moderately heavy base.

### Utensils

Tools. (Not every invention is a step forwards—pay attention to how versatile it is and how the material works with different ingredients.)

* Measuring cup
* Digital scale
* Honing steel
* Rolling pin
* Balloon whisk
* Grater
* Metal sieve
* Slotted spoon
* Ladle
* Metal spatula (Sliding under delicate food)
* Thermometer (Look for one with a probe that can rest in a pan. Those that read to 410 F (210 C), can also be used for caramelizing sugar.)
* Rubber spatula (Delicate work)
* Wooden spoon (easy on the surface, poor conductor of heat, but it's a porous material and needs thorough cleaning!)
* Mixing bowl (Stainless steel lasts a long time, but can't be put in a microwave. Tempered glass is heat-resistant and microwave-friendly. Ceramic and stoneware can chip, are slow to warm, so ideal for working with dough.)
* Chopping board (Durable and good for all foods, wooden boards have "give" so they don't dull knives, unlike granite and glass. Plastic traps bacteria in grooves, while wood has bacteria-killing tannins, making it a hygienic choice.)

### Meat and poultry

All made of the same three tissues, varying proportions determine flavor and texture and its best culinary usage.
* Muscle.
  * Red or pink in color and makes up the bulk of most cuts of meat. 70 to 85 percent water—moisture that needs to be conserved to keep cooked meat juicy.
  * Made of thousands of hair-width strands, packed with moisture and protein.
  * Tender cuts need minimal cooking to retain moisture. Marbled muscle can be cooked slowly.
* Fat.
  * Chewy and bland uncooked, but imparts huge amounts of flavor when the fat cells burst open during cooking.
  * Each fat cell contains a droplet of oil which bursts open when heated, dissolving flavor molecules.
  * Tasteless when raw, fat turns into oil when cooked, carrying flavor and giving a moist mouthfeel.
* Connective tissue.
  * Forms sheathes around muscle fibers and connects muscles to bone — it slowly breaks down during cooking, imparting rich flavor to meat dishes.
  * Made of protein that soften and break down when heated to 126 F / 52 C.
  * Long slow cooking transforms it into velvety gelatin, giving meat its succulence.

Know your white meat
* Chicken
  * Fat medium, protein high
  * Not high in fat, so it has a dry mouthfeel if overcooked. Cooking it in a sauce can help to introduce moisture.
* Duck
  * Fat medium, protein medium
  * Rich, dark duck meat has a thick layer of fat under the skin. Roasting, frying, or grilling works best; prick or score the skin first to help the fat melt.
* Turkey
  * Fat low, protein high
  * With lots of muscle and little fat, white turkey meat is good for stir-frying and grilling. The dark leg meat contains more connective tissue and can be stewed.

Know your red meat
* Beef
  * Fat high, protein medium
  * A cow's large endurance muscles produce dark, rich meat that suits both slow and fast cooking methods. Cuts that contain muscle marbled with fat will be more succulent.
* Lamb
  * Fat medium, protein medium
  * Fat provides lambs with their day-to-day fuel, so most cuts are marbled with fat. Lamb is suited to most methods of cooking, but the sinewy shoulder and leg cuts need to be cooked down slowly.
* Pork
  * Fat high, protein lowest
  * Ranging from pale pink to rose, pork cuts often have a thick layer of fat that helps keep the meat moist when cooking. Lean fillets and steaks require fast cooking methods to stop them from drying out.
* Venison
  * Fat low, protein high
  * As deer are ranging animals, deer meat contains more muscle and connective tissue than fat. Braise or stew small, lean cuts to conserve moisture, or roast large cuts, which will have a lot of connective tissue.
