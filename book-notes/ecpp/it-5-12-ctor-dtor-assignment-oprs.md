# Constructors, destructors, and assignment operators

### Know what functions C++ silents writes and calls

If you don't declare a copy constructor, copy assignment operator, or destructor, C++ declares and defines one for you.
If you don't declare any constructors, C++ declares a default constructor for you.
Note that the generated dtor is not virtual, unless the class is derived from a class with a virtual dtor.

Consider this example
```cpp
template<typename T>
class NamedObject {
public:
  NamedObject(const char *name, const T& value);
  NamedObject(const std::string& name, const T& value);

  ...

private:
  std::string nameValue;
  T objectValue;
};

NamedObject<int> no1("Smallest Prime Number", 2);

NamedObject<int> no2(no1); // calls compiler-supplied copy constructor
                           // this calls copycon of string to copy
                           // nameValue, and copies the bits of int
                           // (instantiated type, in this case a primitive
                           // type) to copy objectValue.
no2 = no1;                 // copy assignment, calls the copy assignment of
                           // string, and copies over the bits of int

// in fact, compiler generated copy assignment behaves as described above
// only when resulting code is both legal and has a reasonable chance of
// making sense.

// suppose we have this instead

template<class T>
class NamedObject {
public:
  // this ctor no longer takes a const name, because nameValue
  // is now a reference-to-non-const string. The char* constructor
  // is gone, because we must have a string to refer to.
  NamedObject(std::string& name, const T& value);

  ...                               // as above, assume no
                                    // operator= is declared
private:
  std::string& nameValue;           // this is now a reference
  const T objectValue;              // this is now const
};

// then consider this code
std::string newDog("Persephone");
std::string oldDog("Satch");

NamedObject<int> p(newDog, 2);

NamedObject<int> s(oldDog, 36);

p = s;                                       // what should happen to
                                             // the data members in p?
// Should the reference in p itself be modified, to refer to s instead?
// C++ doesn't allow that.
// Should the referred-to string be modified?
// In this case, C++ refuses to compile the code.
// Similarly, if the class contains const members, copy assignment opr
// won't be generated. Or if the class derives from a base class whose
// copy assignment is made private, the class's copy assignment won't
// work. 
```

**Takeaways**
* Compilers may implicitly generate a class's default constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor

### Explicitly disallow the use of compiler generated functions you don't want

As of C++03, the key to the solution is that all the compiler generated functions are public.
To prevent these functions from being generated, you must declare them yourself, but there is nothing that requires that you declare them public. Instead, declare the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator private.
By declaring a member function explicitly, you prevent compilers from generating their own version, and by making the function private, you keep people from calling it.
And you don't implement it, so that member functions or friends cannot call these private functions.
(Or, you could declare a base class Uncopyable whose copycon and assignment opr are made private, and make your class private inherit from Uncopyable, in which case, when trying to call your class's copycon or assignment opr within a friend, you'd get compiler error instead of linker error, which is preferable.)

This would be obsolete by EMC++ item 11.

**Takeaways**
* To disallow functionality automatically provided by compilers, declare the corresponding member functions private and give no implementations. Using a base class like Uncopyable is one way to do this.

### Declare dtors virtual in polymorphic base classes

Declare a virtual destructor in a class if and only if that class contains at least one virtual function. (if it does not, it usually indicates the class is not meant to be inherited from)

The bottom line is that gratuitously declaring all destructors virtual is just as wrong as never declaring them virtual.

It is possible to get bitten by the non-virtual destructor problem even in the complete absence of virtual functions. For example, the standard string type contains no virtual functions, but misguided programmers sometimes use it as a base class anyway:
```cpp
class SpecialString: public std::string {   // bad idea! std::string has a
  ...                                       // non-virtual destructor
};

std::string* ptr = new SpecialString(...);
...
// undefined behavior
delete ptr;
```
The same analysis applies to any class lacking a virtual destructor, including all the STL container types (e.g., vector, list, set, std::unordered\_map.)
Don't inherit from STL container types!

Occasionally it can be convenient to give a class a pure virtual destructor: if you want an abstract class (one that cannot be instantiated) but you don't have any pure virtual functions for it. You could give it a pure virtual dtor, but remember you have to provide a definition for this pure virtual dtor.

```cpp
class AWOV {                            // AWOV = "Abstract w/o Virtuals"
public:
  virtual ~AWOV() = 0;                  // declare pure virtual destructor
};

AWOV::~AWOV() {}                     // definition of pure virtual dtor
```
Reason for needing a definition being when destroying an object of a derived class, the base class's dtor will be called after that of the derived class, and you provide a definition to base class's dtor since otherwise the linker would complain. 

Some classes are designed to be used as base classes, yet are not designed to be used polymorphically.
Such classes â€” examples include Uncopyable from Item 6, are not designed to allow the manipulation of derived class objects via base class interfaces.
As a result, they don't need virtual destructors.

**Takeaways**
* Polymorphic base classes should declare virtual destructors. If a class has any virtual functions, it should have a virtual destructor
* Classes not designed to be base classes or not designed to be used polymorphically should not declare virtual destructors
