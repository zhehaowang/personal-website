Hesiod Theogony, Work and Days

Chaos
Gaia, Tartarus, Eros, Nyx
Uranus - Gaia
Cronus - Rhea
Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter

Hestia is rarely mentioned in literature, almost negligible in mythology, but presumably very important in religion.

Zeus - Hera
Ares (whom everyone hates), Enyo, Hebe, Eileithyia (childbirth), Eris (discord), Hephaestus (Hera by herself)

Zeus - Metis (wisdom)
Athena (from Zeus's head. Zeus swallows Metis who gave birth to Athena inside Zeus. Metis's son is prophecied to overthrow Zeus. One of the rare cases where gods / mortals cheat fate. Greeks believed thoughts / wisdom comes from the torso, and Metis gave counsel to Zeus from inside his belly.)

In men's meeting with gods at Mecone to decide sacrifice, Prometheus tried to trick Zeus into picking the pile of bones covered by meat and fat as sacrifice, and leaving the pile of meat covered by bones and unedible parts to human. Zeus knew and decided to punish Prometheus by punishing men, and took fire from them.
Prometheus later stole fire and gave it back to men, for which act he was chained to a pillar and have his liver grown everyday to be eaten by an eagle. Zeus punished men, too, for Prometheus stealing fire, by giving men the first woman, named Pandora in Work and Days.
Heracles rescued Prometheus from the chain.

While these are from Theogony, many anecdotes / stories we hear today are actually from Ovid's metamorphoses.
