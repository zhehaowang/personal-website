# History of food

### Stone age cooking

Gatherer hunters

We gather more than we hunt. Just that the bigger bones stick around more easily

Sea people move less than inland people.
Colder arctic areas generally have less variety in their diet.

### Early agriculturalists

Why did agriculture, or the domestication of plants come about?

A combination of accidents (storing food underground and seeing them grow), need (the food source that a group used to rely on becomes no longer available), and its ability to stably sustain larger amount of people. (As their gathering / society being more successful, the natural selection process passed the genes and habits of these collections of people on.)

Agriculture was not present among native Australians, Amazonians, etc, perhaps for lack of need for agriculture, or the lack of suitable plants to domesticate.

Suitable usually meaning a starch-based plant, wheat (Eurasia), rice (Asia), sorghum (Africa), potato (Americas), corn (Americas), quinoa (Americas).
First cultivation of wheat was found in the middle east. Syria, Israel, east Turkey, etc.

Domestication of animals followed suit. Dogs, sheep, goats, cattle (herding animals, usually herbivores) were among the first ones domesticated, and they were rarely bred for food, for dairy, utility, etc.

Indus river valley area perhaps saw the first domestication of chicken, usually bred for the eggs.

Pigs were domesticated at a later stage (except in China), due to its lack of utility to the early civilization: they don't eat grass, cannot be milked, etc, and can only provide meat.

Civilizations more reliant on dairy typically develops luctose tolerance.

Civilizations have long depended on benign bacteria for dairy, wine, bread, etc, and evolved along with those that cause disease.
The aboriginal people aren't as exposed to the disease Eurasians carry, and e.g. Meso-Americans, Tasmanians, people of the Canary Islands died in droves upon first contact with Europeans.
