# Scratch

Scratch is a playground for ideas in formulation / research stage.

As each matures their development effort will be tracked in dedicated docs and repos.

# Methodology

### Goal driven research / development

* What question do I want to answer? (and why)
* What research has already been done? What knowledge should I acquire in order to gain good intuition for formulating the problem and coming up with hypotheses to test?
* How do I formulate / quantize the problem into hypothesis?
* To test such hypothesis what data do I need? What program do I need to write? What are the bottlenecks? How do I plan to use such data?
* What are my conclusions? If I can't arrive at any conclusions, backtrack and try again.

### Reasonable documentation

* If we seriously pursue a project, then it should be committed to durable storage.
  * What did we do? Why? Keys on how? What are our conclusions? Did we succeed or fail? What lessons did we learn?
  * What would future me in two years wanting to pick this up again want to know?
  * Content we committed need not be immutable: if they happen to be let's at least run compaction

### Focus

* One can scratch multiple things at the same time, but let's focus one and only one thing in active development. That would be the theme. (similar to the principle of a good photograph should have one and only one subject)

# Reference

* The Creative Habit:

Scratching as the first step of a creative act is like groping in the dark, random and chaotic, feverish and fearful.

We scratch for ideas through reading, everyday conversation, people's handiwork, mentors and heroes, and nature.
