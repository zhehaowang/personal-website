# The Great Ideas of Philosophy

Questions of **Knowledge**, **Conduct**, and **Governance**.

### Did the Greeks invent it all

What differentiates the works of Pythagoras, Plato, etc from those of Homer, Sophocles, Confucius, Buddha etc?

In philosophy there is a **critical, disinterested skepticism**, towards the principles we hold, and even mandates of God.
The pursuit would be **wisdom itself**, not wisdom for the sake of something else.
And a philosophical realization made through skeptical analysis and debates would not end with an exclamation mark, but with semicolon.

The Greek civilization of 6 Century BC would not have been more powerful than the Egyptians or Persians, yet the latter were not considered to have laid the foundations of Western civilization.
How developed the thoughts are of a people / country / culture does not necessarily reflect how wealthy / powerful the group is (their ability to solve practical problems and influence others).
Nor would philosophy be the product of a leisurely Hellenistic upper class built upon labor of slaves and indentured servants.
Egyptians and Persians would have been better suited in that regard.

Greek religion tends to have an estrangement: Gods are revered but aloof and indifferent towards our matters.
The fundamental questions of being would not be something you consult the Oracle for, but rather left to reason about by ourselves.
We ourselves need to make order (classification) out of the chaos of this world.
The state would be religious but without a state religion.

Imagine us as puppets made by the Gods with various cords in it, these cords, reflecting pleasure, pain and emotions pull us in different directions.
One cord is sacred and golden, that of reason and calculations. And when one follows this cord, one is virtuous.

(Plato, The Laws)

### Pythagoras and the divinity of number

Abstract transcendance philosophy (vs natural philosophy would be the focus of later Greek / Aristotle philosophy).

Pythagoras, rich family, shrouded in mystery.
Learnt maths (fractions, calendar predicting Nile flood) from his Egyptian travels.
Rumor has it he traveled and taught in Babylon / India.
Spent most of his life traveling, came back to Greece as a governor and founded his sect.
Pythagoras did poorly as a governor. A philosophically-guided state may not be well suited to the brutal reality.

**Cynics** are an important Pre-Socratic philosophical school. Diogenes. Nothing too excess.

**Pythagoreanism**: abstract idea is the ultimate creator of material and physical realities, and that idea is numbers, hence divinity of numbers, in particular 1 (point), 2 (line), 3 (plane), 4 (solid, tetrahedron, special place in Pythagorean teaching), sum is 10, also sacred in Pythagoreanism.
The lawfulness with which we enter social life is based off of numbers.

Also known for his theorem on right angle triangle and (himself / his school's) contribution to discovery of harmonic structure of music (harmony, matches with something in the soul; what creates a harmony is the relationship between notes) (part of the intended design of the cosmos).

Over time we won't exist but rectilinear triangle will, mathematical abstractions will, and will remain correct, precise in describing the relationships in physical world.

Also believes in transmigration of souls, death liberates something in us.

Pi, e, sqrt(-1) has no place in Pythagoreanism?

Sophia, wisdom itself; and Pythagoras considered himself a philosopher, as he strived to and have befriended wisdom itself.

Elegance and simplicity expressed in mathematical, formulaic equation.

### What is there (metaphysics)

A metaphysical question.

Real object, perception and distortion, what is beyond there.

If our senses (always) lie, how would we know reality.

Aristotle notes that they have just completed a systematic consideration of nature / the physical world, and what is natural.

Centuries later people notes his work after the physics treatise as metaphysics: after the physics / natural science work.

**Metaphysics** deals with the subject of real existence.
* What is there: **ontology** (being, the branch of metaphysics that deals with reality and existence. After change, does the original still exist? Cause and effect. Are there minds and thoughts, or just peculiar states of the brain, are they merely terms hankering to superstitution? Does what really exists vary being by being i.e. sensory apparatus? What sort of being am I? What am I made of, made for?)
* Our modes of knowing: **epistemology**. Epistemological (systematic, organization and principle of facts) questions: are senses wrong? If so, what is right? Abstract rationality of Pythagoras? Customs? Religion? Epistemology is the study, criticism and refinements of our modes of knowing. Epistemic justification.

Is there heaven? Is there such a thing as goodness? Is there a moral reality and objectivity? Is there real beauty? Is there truth? Is there right or wrong?

The conclusion we reach is more or less based on the method we choose, often times blindly, by habit, social condition or conventional wisdom.
There tends to be a vicious circularity, between the claim (ontology) and the methods (epistemology).

Certainly the harmony and balance Greek perceived as beautiful, is not the same as what medieval artists found beautiful in their depiction of human form.
Yet the Greeks philosophers were unaware of the shifting.

**Democritus**: ultimate reality is but an incredibly large of atoms. Atoms and the space in between (the void).
Everything is ultimately reducible to that level. What we see as flowers, buildings, animals are but ephemeral, different in atomic composition.
The soul is a finer kind of atomics structure.

Earth, air, fire and water.

Can we even answer the ontological questions? Beautiful or ugly? True or false? Moral or not?

**Heraclitus**: "no one descends twice in the same river". Sees nothing but flux and change.

**Protagoras**: pre-Socratic. Founding father of **Sophist** thought.
"Man is the measure of all things."
Judgment of any form, must have some grounding, and that grounding can only be the experiences of a lifetime, we cannot take an epistemological position external to our own human ways of thought and feeling.
If there is a standard independent of human nature, we cannot even comprehend it.

Hence, is pursuing truth a misguided objective? Each person is the measure of all things. Truth is subjective. We are not equipped to comprehend it, even if there might be objective.

About the gods, I cannot say if they are or how they are constituted in shape, the unclarity of the subject and the shortness of human lives.
I can write you about what I see and hear and touch, but I cannot write you about the gods.

**Socrates** spends much of his work disputing the Sophists: much can be questioned about the claim.
Each man not only is not the measure of all things, we are generally very poor in understanding ourselves.
With him philosophy becomes a humanizing and humanistic enterprise (the human condition), from which there is no retreat.

### Greek tragedian on men's fate

Dance is important in Homer, Ovid and other classical authors. Dance of cranes Theseus.

Chorus + Dance + Participants and preliterate history and moral thought.

Out of possibility of drama comes the dispute and dialogue.
Philosophy may have come from cultural activities such as drama.
The thought refining itself.

The human condition as understood by the dramatists.
Is Medea a murderess, or are her motives irresistable? (Her sorcery practices are of Chthonic and pre-Olympian. When we surrender reason to passion, chaos ensues.)
What about the trial of Orestes?
The debate on Nomos (norm, natural law). Antigone. Is the law of kings higher, or the nature that sisters should bury brothers?

Euripides heroic characters are very much human.
At the end of day, character is destiny.

Aristotle's view on women, vs that of Greek tragedians.
Aristotle's view on tragedy: bad things happening to good people.

If there's an all seeing and all loving god, why such evil and injustice around us?

### Herodotus and history

Herodotus's Histories attributes war to irreconcilable differences in value.
Legions are moved with words and symbols.

Histories describes various people's dress, weapon, food, economonies and religious belief, to give a full perspective on events of historical significance, as opposed to mythology where such accounts on humanistic details are often glossed over.

Herodotus would suggest to account for events of historical significance, perspectives on sociology, pyschology beyond mere chronology is required.
And his teaching, or that of history, would be meaningful beyond ethnicity, and calls onto the roots of humanity itself.

Histories has clear distinctions for Herodotus's own opinions, opinions he has heard and facts.

His work, however, has many inaccurate accounts to establish some morals on the question of conduct. E.g. the emblematic meeting between Croesus and Solon, where the happiest men are established to be Kleobis and Biton, two sons who yoked themselves to their mother's cart, such that their mother, a priestess, would not be late for the festival of Hera.
They died peacefully after the deed.
Solon would claim only after one's story is complete can one be judged whether their lives being happy or not, and human happiness is not dependent on wealth.

### Socrates on the examined life

Teaching of Socrates is preserved by Zenophon and Plato (broad shoulders), who claims to be the mere scribe but his works are much more a portrayal of his and Socrates's thoughts via Socrates's mouth, than mere description.

Socrates lived in a time when Athens lost the Peloponnesian War against Sparta, and as a loyal faithful soldier of Athens, his thoughts are very often on the practical side, what went wrong with Athens, in matters of educating the youth, of conduct and government.
The Dialogues are conducted by the losing side, which often explains him taking a Spartan view on the matters above.

Socrates described himself as a gadfly asking those confident in their thoughts, reminding us of the gadfly sent by Zeus to unseat Bellerophon from Pegasus, an analogy for unseating the confident writers.

He was well trained by his Sophist teachers (sophistical teaching), known for their skills in debate and rhetorics and to expose the ignorance of the interlocuter via whimsical and deft conversations.

Yet Socrates aimed to defeat the skepticism and cynicism, claiming that there is something we can truly know, and knowing that our methodology of knowing is sound, contrasting his thoughts from those of Pythagoras.

St. Augustine would consider Socrates the only true philosopher, one committed to living and dying by his own philosophy, the inquiries he perceived as true, and the cause of reason, not like Pyrrho / Pyrrhonism (a school of skepticism).

Socrates was found guilty of failure to respect the Gods, despite him being a reverential person, and corrupting the youth. The Symposium, which has inquires on the nature of love, ended with Socrates returning home alone.

Neither charges were truthful, and Socrates had the choice of death or exile (ostracism of at least 10 yrs, on which Pericles was also charged), and choose the former (hemlock poisoning) in defense of his thoughts, and the rule of law (the public expression of rational thoughts, reason without passion).

A Homeric ending (think Hector "breaker of horses") where upon death, he uttered "will you remember to pay the debt".

Socrates would teach "the unexamined life is not worth living".
What is wrong with the unexamined?
Socrates would describe it as a screen on which events are laid out and not a lived life, as prisoners living in a cave watching parapets on which the shadows of puppets are cast, where all they see is shadows and illusion.

Examine, in the sense of interpretation of meaning of events, integration of experience, subject to the refinements through self criticism and introspection, and making the thought whole.

This connects back to the motto at the Oracle of Delphi "know thyself", meaning knowing what it means to be a human being? Beyond the biology, constituents, etc.
The Socratic agenda would argue against skepticism and cynicism, and realizing the interconnectedness between matters of knowledge, conducts and governance.
Dealing first with knowledge and establishing a good philosophical basis that there is something we can know, one kernel of truth we can know (if we can't know anything as the skepticists claim, then the life is uselessly examined, prejudices and self deceptions).
If it is possible to know something, know that you know it, and know the methodology of knowing it, then we can inquire into what kind of life is right for beings such as ourselves? Happiness and pleasure? Are they the same for all people, all cultures?
What about our values? Are they just relative, opinions and prejudices? What about governance, how should we be governed? Are the core precepts of Athenian democracy to be questioned?

Socrates would question Athenian democracy which Aristotle would later defend, claiming the collective wisdom is more likely to make good decisions as opposed to the strength of one, and the weaknesses are likely to cancel each other out.

### Plato and the search for Truth

To be able to arrive at any truth, one first defeats the skepticism claim that nothing can definitively be known.

Plato's Meno deals with the search for Truth, where Socrates converses with Meno, a noble from an area with strong Sophist presence, on whether virtue comes from teaching, or nature.

Socrates in Meno instructs by guiding the barbarian servant boy of Meno's to discovering the Pythagoras theorem.
And claims knowledge is a form of reminiscence, where, through philosophical guidance, one is no longer clouded by the sensory systems of the material world, and recalls the Truth that the soul had always known.

Hence Plato establishes that **Truth** is different from **facts**, where the former is eternal, not sensory, and cannot come by perceptions, and the latter is ephemeral, material, and as Heraclitus would claim, always in flux, as the material world would be.

Facts are various forms of rectilinear triangles drawn on the sand (flux, ephemeral, and material), and Truth is Pythagorean theorem that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is the true form of rectilinear triangle. (Aristotle would argue this is Platonic and not Socratic. Plato's work is also divided by later scholars into early, mid, and late where some ideas came earlier are later revised.)

How is Truth acquired? One has it intuitively. The gift of rationality.

Plato draws much from Pythagoras, in illustrating Truth with his discovery, and in transmigration of souls where he would claim with death, the soul is liberated.

Plato considers mathematical Truth an example of knowledge we know for certainty, and where the skepticists are wrong, but the debate would continue with evolution on both sides.

To Plato the problem then becomes identifying mathematics-like Truth, and it can be discovered by **the dialectical approach**, to achieve something abstract and uncover what one has always possessed but became clouded by the material world.

To this end, it is also thought that the discovery of Truth has naught to do with experience, and the experience of many do not necessarily draw us any closer to Truth, than the experience of one.
On this ground Socrates would question the basis of Athenian democracy.

### Can virtue be taught (Plato's Protagoras)

Problem of conduct, to each his own? Vicious, hedonistic?
Is there truth to ethics, morality? Is there moral objectivity?

The Socratic / Platonic school would combat the skepticists in the above domain, claiming the problem of conduct is not to be solved at the level of merely personal desire.
The same argumentative approach to knowledge should be applied.

How life should be lived? What kind of life is right for beings such as ourselves?

Plato's Protagoras.

Setting: Protagoras is in town, a young 30s Socrates put several questions to Hippocrates (not the physician) who woke him up to this news.

Socrates then raises the questions to Protagoras, who eloquently discourses on virtue, conduct, etc.
Socrates and Protagoras then engaged in Socratic dialectical method, and hard to say who had the upper hand.

What do you want to be, that makes you want to study under Protagoras?
Protagoras claims moral excellence.

What is virtue? (Justice, temperance, courage, wisdom, etc, what are they? Parts of virtue? Parts in what sense?)
Is virtue teachable?

Both men agree knowledge is the greatest, and there must be knowledge first, before there is virtue.
Knowledge known in some non-sensory way.

How do we teach anybody anything?
We teach by providing sensible, visible, ostensive objects.
Anything taught by showing, cannot be universal.
What do you point to, to say that is virtue, to teach virtue?

The teaching of technique, vs the teaching of Sophia?

You can't show the universal, but you can show an instance of it.
Perhaps we can teach virtue by pointing to persons practicing virtue.
Point Leonidas at Thermopylae to a one year old, and he wouldn't be able to comprehend.

Socrates argues to the conclusion virtue cannot be taught as such.
Perhaps the knowledge (wisdom), attained by philosophical reflection, is the grounding of virtue. This is teachable.
The one-year-olds aren't ready for it, many aren't ready for it in their entire lives.

The students must have been prepared (to be receptive of such lessons), then you may find such persons resonating to the virtuous act, when it presents itself.

What kind of preparation is necessary, for one to be considered ready for instructions by the virtuous?
This is discussed in The Republic.

Theaetetus is another piece where Protagoras is a central figure, and claims men is the measure of all things. I will do things that please me.
At the end of the day, the problem of conduct is a problem of principle, something universally right.

The Socratic approach to knowledge would claim each man is not the measure of all things.
There is a measure of all things, and it's the task of each man to understand that measure and apply it properly.

### Plato's Republic

Late-middle dialogue.

Russell on the Republic: fascist and imperialistic.

Foundational work in political science.
Tied to the considerations of statecraft are observations on moral, justice, weakness of human, hence somewhat foundational in psychology.

Sepheles, near death and ponders on wealth.
Polymarchus, what it means to be just is to pay one's debt.

Can an unjust person be happy and make great progress?

Thrasymachus: strong should prey on the weak.

Glaucon: what is goodness? Three classes
* Things that are good in and of themselves. Harmless pleasures.
* Things that are good in themselves but also for the consequences that arise from such good. Knowledge, health.
* Pursued for the sake of their results. Gymnastics, money making.

Where is justice placed?
Socrates: the first, where things are pursued for their intrinsic value, not for consequences.

Glaucon, Adeimantus: Those seem just may not be just.
Virtue may arise purely from fear of punishment and desire of reward, not for the sake of being virtuous.

Example of Ring of Gyges (invisibility, used to commit unjust).

Being just may be for reputation, not for the sake of justice.

Socrates suggests to inspect the state instead, so that we can seek justice on an enlarged scale, rather than on each flimsy individuals.

No claim can be made towards politics, without understanding human nature.

Guardians. Elimination of greed, no payments. Shared partners. Marriage "lottery" in festivals but actually chosen breeders. Breed the guardians. Pure eugenics.

Problem of knowledge.
Allegory of the cave. Being shackled and faced with parapets with projections, shadowy illusions. Each man his own measure.
Imagine one breaks out, discovers the outside and realized what they've perceived as true are merely halluciatory experience.
This one goes back to share his experience, the others wouldn't be able to comprehend and instead thought him as blinded by the light.

Being bound by our material selves, resisting transcendance, believing whatever we see and only what we see.
Ignorance is darkness. See the reality behind the appearance of shadowy illusions. To appreciate / comprehend Leonidas at Thermopylae, one needs to be preconditioned.

The eyes and ears never record the truth, and what they do pick up will never be parlayed into the truth.
Being experientialist, while missing the point of life, not even understanding life has a point.

There are some things that only be seen under the light of philosophical examination / the wise man's guidance.

Problem of knowledge then gets us back to the search of truth, of the relationship as the relationships constitute the true form of things.

What is a good government is then answered in terms of relationship: between the ruled and the rulers, laws, where authority is vested and for what purpose.
Justice is also perceived as the the harmonious relationship among the rational, the passionate, the emotional dispositions of the soul.

Also behavioral theory e.g. children has to be protected from vulgar music but exposed to martial music.

How should we behave? How should we live our lives?
We are corporeal, inclined towards pleasure and avoid pains.
We are like charioteers standing on two horses, a good horse and a vicious one, a metaphor also found in India. 

A will capable of resolving us to follow the right course.
The will itself cannot decide what the right course is, desire knows only one course: to fulfill itself.
How then do we discover the right course: through rational power. Supremacy of reason in determining what we ought to do. Reason as shown in mathematical proportion, harmony, balance. The guide and goal of life. Avoid excess.

Until kings become philosophers and philosophers become kings, there would be no justice in the world.

The Pythagorean numerological balance is the resemblance of truth.

### Hippocrates of Kos and Greek medicine

Contemporary of Socrates.

Plato -> Aristotle (whose father was a physician), movement in the direction of natural science

Secularize and analyze a subject that is generally related with religion and customs.

Greek medicine is close to modern practices in its being scientific, realizes diet, hereditary disposition as causes for conditions. (Health as related with the state of the body, as opposed to religion and customs.)

Few (or perhaps none) of the writings of Hippocratic school were by Hippocrates himself.

Pythagoras' sect of medical views: treat the body with vegetarianism, ritual performance (musical harmony) and exercises.

Hellenic civilization objectified itself (and the natural world), for the purpose of critical scrutiny.
Secularizing of knowledge, as opposed to realizations brought by prophets.

Hippocratic writers are religious, but they hold the religious account constant.
They provide a science that is liberated from religious orthodoxy.
Hippocratic medicine is not necessarily superior to Egyptian medicine, which dates even earlier, but it is based on an entirely different set of suppositions.

Once a society confers upon a selected group ultimate epistemological authority, on core questions arising from the problem of knowledge, the nearly inevitable result is philosophical paralysis: positions become quite hardened, and the only work left for scholars is to interpret the words of the wise.
The debate is no longer about knowledge and truth, but how a text or holy maxim is to be understood.

Empirical. Empiricist. The Greek word "observation".
Science is an empirical enterprise.

Hippocratic writers describe themselves as empirical, as their treatment is based off of clinical observation, naturalizing the natural world.

How is apoplexy understood?
Eastern Christianity, influenced by Greek thoughts, perceives it as a viral attack on the body (empirical).
Western Christianity, much more (theological) theory driven, perceives it as retribution for the victim's wickedness (divine, spiritual intervention).

Hippocratic writers correctly identified the brain as the central organ that processes sensory information, being correct whereas Aristotle was not (heart, while brain controls the temperature of the blood).

The celebrated figures of this age (Socrates, Hippocrates, Aristotle, etc), were a conspicuous minority.
This would be an uncommon group in any age. The mass of the people has a deep suspicion towards philosophers.
The perspective developed by these few was not widely shared.

There was a perfectionist idea wide spread in Hellenistic civilization. In rhetorics, tragedy, physical competitions, architecture, works of art, etc.
Similarly in mathematics and philosophy.

Hellenism bequeathed this pursuit to later societies.

### Aristotle on the knowable

The Lyceum.

Aristotle has so much original, hence so much criticism from those who came after.

His role in logic, biology, physics, natural science, political science and metaphysics are fundamental.

He spent 20yrs in Plato's Academy, where some small fraction of his teachings are present in Plato's dialogues.

Aristotle's **Metaphysics** proposed many thoughts different from Socratic and Platonic view.

It offered a presentation of pre-Socratic and Socratic schools of thoughts, serving as a good account of the history of philosophy and Hellenic thoughts in general.

Aristotle usually inspects the historical work done, what is left wanting, and goes from there.

##### On senses

Metaphysics opens with

_"All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses"_

This sets a fundamentally different tone from a Platonic dismissiveness towards senses.
**Nature produces nothing without a purpose**, and senses do not exist to deceive creatures.
Perception must be the starting point of knowledge.

##### On classification

Aristotle proposes different perceptual modes of knowledge.

What's the fundamental power (Greek word Dynamics) in which a living thing has life?
* Nutritive. A living creature has the means to absorb nutritions from its surroundings to sustain itself.
* Reproductive. A living species can reproduce.
* Locomotive. Some living creatures have the power to move. Some plants don't.
* Sensation. The ability to act knowingly / consciously. Animals possess this.
* Rationality. The (soul / psyche / power) of reason / a special rationality / cognitive power to allow beings to grasp universal propositions: all men must die, vs that men died. Our laws is another example of generality.

Aristotle's view on knowing also differs from Plato's.
As opposed to Plato's Meno in which he talks about facts and Truth with the latter being awakening something we inherently know via dialectical methods.

Aristotle claims there are two modes of knowing, e.g. the angles of a triangle sums up to 180
* By measurement. This is by experience and factual.
* By definition. This is episteme and appeals to generality.

##### On the cause

_"Happy is the man who knows the cause of things"_

What's the cause of a statue?
* On the **material level**, there's the stone. It couldn't have existed otherwise.
* A statue possesses certain features to differentiate it from just any stone. This is the cause on the **formal level**.
* Then there's the **efficient cause** of one blow after another by the sculptor, where each blow is the cause for the next.
* Finally how do you know where to hit the material? You have to know what you aim to achieve. Then the **ultimate / final cause** is that intelligent design.

Final in time, first in conception.

Unless you have an intelligent plan to begin with, otherwise nothing will come about.
(Greek telos. A teleological explanation, identifying the purposes, plans, designs and goals)

Teleological does not assume sentient beings.
Evolutionary theory is teleological, where wings, mating behavior, etc serve specific purposes.

We do not understand something fully unless we know **all four modalities**.
The number of things we know are based on the questions we ask:
* does it exist? 
* If it does, to what degree?
* In what relation does it stand to other things?
* What is it for? 

The central point of Aristotelian program are these four causes / questions, in domain of knowledge, politics, ethics, etc.

In politics, what is the polis for?

In ethics, what kind of being am I? How do the actions of my mine either realize what is potential within me, or stultify such potentials? What am I here for (my potentials?) How do I live my life to honor the central fact of my being?

Living things of the universe fit in a plan.
Nothing with pattern or design comes about accidentally.

_"If the art of shipbuilding were in the wood, ships would exist by nature."_

Ask the ultimate question: what is it for?
To know in this sense, is to comprehend far more than anything conveyed by the mere composition of the object.

What are atoms for?
Knowing all are made of atoms is pure materiality, and does not rise to the level of episteme.

Aristotle's explanation is usually universal (by and large, in general) and deterministic.
E.g. his view on scientific theory needs to be general, where the explained event is a particular instance.

### Aristotle on Friendship

Men are by nature social and political.

Bees and swans are social by nature, too.

The natural Aristotle question (what is it for) then becomes:
What's the point of us grouping ourselves together?
What purpose is served by the tendency towards complex (and larger scale) social and political lives?

Why go beyond small tribal communities? Why a polis?
Self-defense? Large communities are destroyed left and right.
Trade? Tribal communities, too, trade.

Discussed in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics.

Friendship is first inspected in the two works of Ethics.
* Friendship can be formed for pleasure, including sensual pleasure, which Aristotle is not against. These pleasure have an ephemeral feature about them.
* Friendship can be based on utility (utilitarian). A and B are useful for each other. These, too, are often ephemeral.
These friendships are self-regarding, selfishly motivated
* There is also friendship formed on Teleia-philia ("completed / perfected" friendship). Shared by the friends is a set of morals and values. What A wants for B and is good for B for the sake of B. A constructive relationship that is preserved and celebrated. Friendship conduced to goodness / moral excellence itself, and usually lasts a lifetime. Aristotle considers this kind of friendship to be not common.

The above is obtained by two who are equally worthy, few among the general populace.
Some would argue then the polis would be too small with those that meet this moral standard.

How unequal would the two parties need to be for such friendship to be impossible?
The inequality between humans and gods.

An example, an audience with good taste enjoying a performance. The audience does not have the training of the performers, but there is mutual respect and each understands what is best and good in the other, for the other in the other's sake.

Then you could form a polis without all people being morally equal.

What is virtue?
It's a disposition / inclination to act towards certain ends and avoid other ends.

Virtue is to be understood in two senses
* Intellectual excellence. Science, artistic, technical, central to a creative life. These are not innate, and come from learning, discipline and practice.
* Moral excellence. These are habitual forms of activity, and are reinforced by discplined practice as well. Receding Platonic's view of men of gold, silver and bronze, borrowed from Hesiod. (A program of research directed at the world as we know it.)

Is anger (first word in Illiad) good or bad?
Natured equipped us with such emotions, it'd be wrong to say such emotions are pathological.
The right question then becomes what should be one's disposition towards anger? What should one be angry for?

To become angry when virtue triumphs vice is bad.

The virtue is the middle ground of extreme excess and extreme defect.
Courage is the mid point between heedlessness and cowardice.
The middle route is the best (opposing excess, common in Greek thoughts).

Those who are fit to rule are those of virtue who are fit for friendship.

Aristotle claims in the order of things, the polis precedes families (the pattern of obligation parents have towards children and vice versa) and entities (identification of the individual, bound up with familial and political life).

The life of the hearthless, stateless, lawless men is the worst imaginable life.
A productive life involves familial and political duties and obligations.

Aristotle displays a suspiciousness towards radical democratic forms of rule.
His ideal model could be that a constitutional monarchy, where the rule of law is determinated, and those who determine the law function as friends.

### Aristotle on the perfect life

Discussed in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics.

Episteme, the intellectual virtues by which we are able to comprehend the cause of things.

The perfect life, one that guided by scientific, systematic knowledge.

We are artistic objects of self-defining, self-creating nature.
To get a work of art ever more complete.

Make the right kind of choices, based on good reasons.
Good reasons for acting, our actions not merely reactions.

Sound and defensible reasons for action is a form of wisdom and knowledge.
Prudential knowledge.
Philosophically wise -> Sophia 
Practically wise -> Phronesis, making good choices

The right life contemplates the best, what is worth thinking about.
By contemplating on the stock market, you may be lowering your thoughts to the transient, episodic and culturally defined.

Why should one aspire to moral excellence?
Why should one be courageous and temperate?

A regress of questions until it makes no sense to ask why that:
* Why see a doctor?
* Why you want to be in health?
* Why you want to hold on to your job?
* ...
* Ultimately everything we do we do for happiness - **eudaimonia**.

Not in a hedonistic sense.
What does Aristotle mean by eudaimonia?
Not peak emotional experience, or a transient state, but a mode of **flourishing life**, something unique for rational beings and beyond basic instincts.

What does eudaimonia entail?
It's an open question and the two Ethics offer different alternatives.

To lose eudaimonia is like ridding a being of its defining attribute: fish out of water, birds cannot fly, and man without his rationality / contemplating on the best of things.

What you do you do for the sheer fulfillment arising from doing it, is like the life on the isle of the blessed, that of the Olympians.
Like children at play.
One that approximates eudaimonia.

This contemplative life should not be a life of inactivity or isolation, as we are by nature social and political.

Fitness - harmonia <-> discordia
Music - melodia

Aristotle sees the rule of law as the rule of reason, laws based on punishment are tyrannical laws.
Good laws calls upon us to do things that make us better, not stop us from doing things for fear of punishment; we see in the law something we see in good friends.

Are the life of the law giver and the disinterested contemplative wise man competing (activity and decisive action / contemplation and study)?
That's the dillema faced by all, who weigh the contemplation of choices between the first things and making the world conform to one's best judgments.

### Rome, Stoics, Rule of Law

Aristotle left Athens after the death of Alexander.
The city would not sin against philosophy a second time.

Aristotle and Plato had strong influence on Stoic thoughts.
Rule of law, reason and rationality.

Zeno, father of Stoicism, 300BC. Epicurus, father of Epicureanism.
Early, middle (Epictetus) and late (Seneca, Marcus Aurelius) Stoicism.
Owing much to the Socratic / Platonic / Aristotelian school.

Stoic ontology is physicalistic in a subtle way.
Plato, for something to exist it must be able to act or be acted upon.
Non-physical entities (such as space, time) must be accounted for in discussion of physical reality.
Individual man has ontological meaning, but not the collection mankind.

**A law-governed cosmos.**
Reality is governed by law, human affairs and daily life should be governed by law, the hegemonicon of reason that regulates life.
Quite different from a tyrannical law. Law is what a rational being would find justifiable, similar to Aristotle's view.

Wisdom and knowledge are good intrinsically.
Wealth, good breeding are not intrinsically good but may be utilitarian or useless.

Nature of law and morals, rational, proportionate, unprejudiced.
Power of abstraction and comprehension => Liberty.
Liberty is not anarchy, but conforming one's actions to a principle, not dictatorial instincts.

**Apatheia**, (not quite apathetic / morose) an active, systematic and disciplined principle of not to invest importance in things at the emotional level.

Mucius Scaevola, tried to assassinate an enemy Etruscan king, and upon failure, told the bravery and willingness to sacrifice of Romans, and stretched his right arm to be burned.

_"Never say of anything that I've lost it, only that I've given it back."_
-- Epictetus

Cicero was a critic of Stoicism, but his work on law incorporated much essential to Stoic teaching.

Evil is to go against your nature, and the nature of men being rationality.
Irrationality is an evil.

Epicureanism may have left the impression of _"eat drink and be merry for tomorrow you shall die"_, though the actual teaching of Epicurus was conservative in terms of social life and quite contrary, it's rather don't need something so much that its absence causes pain and suffering and quite close to Apatheia.

Stoicism requires us participate in the affairs of the state, to be law givers, interact with the public world, Epicureanism would have us remove ourselves from the polis or politics, imagine living in the suburbs with a close group of friends.
Epicureanism would reduce the likelihood of pain and suffering, defer death as long as one can.
Epicureanism on friendship, a form of self defense against the slings and arrows of misfortune.
Atomic materialistic, our choices are our own to make, liberated from abstract stricture Stoicism imposed.

Stoicism guides Roman education and Roman sensibilities.
Neither Stoicism nor Epicureanism would agree with the decadence of late Roman Empire.

### Stocism to Christianity

Philo of Alexandria, contemporary of Jesus, whose work connects Old Testament text with Greek philosophy.

Christianity is not merely a development out of Judaism.

Early Christian teaching was intellectually rich and convincing.
Saint Paul's writing drew from Stoic teaching.
A belief being a natural inclination.
There should not be unbridgeable gap between the teachings of faith and teachings of (pagan) philosophy.

Stoic philosophy creates this bridge.

Contrary to the Christian / Judaism / Islamic God, the "God" of Stoics is not a personal being concerned with human welfare, but a powerful divine fire of sorts working through physical and material modes of operations.
This divine Fire, however, is rational and immortal in its nature.

Arguments for universal brotherhood and wrongfulness of cruelty towards slaves are based off of Stoic notion of human rationality.
Slaves are of same elements that made up any rational human being (same Oikos).

Jews and Christians deny the materiality of this God.
This is reconciled by God becoming incarnated in the form of a human being who will teach lessons and guide the distracted human race to be redeemed through his sacrifice.

The immaterial incarnating himself materially, into what Stoics regarded as Logos (natural law).
Consult the ten commandments to comprehend what God demands of us.

On a Christian account no one is of greater moral worth than the other, whatever their socio-economic status, titles and achievements.
This might have a substantial effect on people who are oppressed, controlled, dismissed because of their birth, language, skills and position in the world.
None of that counts for anything fundamentally, you are all children of a providential God, who has created the cosmos, and it is good.
An ordered, reasonable cosmos fitting for the language-using ordered, rational being which reflects in its rationality nothing less than the image of God himself.

Early Christian fathers are Neo-Platoists and reflect much of Platonic teaching.

This brings more problem:
* Given this providential God, what about all the evil in the world? War and crimes, fall of Rome? How come things are in the state they are in, us being the rational creatures but bogged down in ignorance and pettiness?
* If there is this God whose will is unopposable, then my fate is determined and God knows everything I'm going to do with my life. Is this an echo of the Greek sense of fate? A fatalistic doctrine?

The Stoic Apatheia becomes the reconciliation between oneself and the will of God.
A willingness to die for what he believes in and a willingness to recognize the fate of the flesh are distinct from the fate of the soul.

Anti-intellectualism in early Christianity.
What is required for one to live the right sort of life, is nothing more than the teaching of Christ.
We need not speculate any longer on the meaning of all things.

As these were the teachings of Jesus Christ, they are the last words on all things true, and coming after the pagan philosophies, they were not available to them who did not have the benefit of Jesus Christ.
All of their philosophy was a distraction we can safely move past.
Rome is not falling for its lack of philosophical teaching, and Christianity has to base off of something more resistant to change, on truths that are not mere productions of philosophy but creation of divinity, made available to us by the Grace of God.

Not an anti-intellectualism with a sneer, but that of an enlightened group towards a less enlightened community, the former saying we can have patience with them and understand the mistakes they make, and we are under no obligation to repeat their modes of thoughts or conduct.

There was a bridge from Stoicism to Christianity, once you got to the side of a Christian, to a considerable extent, philosophy was left on the other side, for better or worse.

### Roman Law

Ancient Greek law is highly developed, nonetheless if there is a contribution the Roman world made to civilization and the history of ideas (acknowledging its debts to Greek law), that contribution is Roman law.
For its development, precision, refinement, promulgation.

Keystone in western civilization.
Life of freedom under the governance of the law.

12 tables of Rome, Romans rumored to take counsel from Solon in Athens.

Cicero on Laws.
What is the essence of law?

There seem to be certain universal precepts that are honored without exception across different jurisdictions.
Cicero calls these precepts the law of nations / peoples.
The explanation Cicero offers for this universality is that it arises from something within human nature itself: something essential to the rational being.

Later called, **the natural law**, and associated with Thomas Aquinas.

_"Ignorance of the law excuses no one."_
Not to know this much is part of being a defective being.

Aristotle also describes the universality of core principles.
He uses Sophocles's Antigone and Creon to illustrate this.

The law of Rome lived on to the conquering barbarians, e.g. Visigoths.

The Institutes of Justinian. The Justinian Code.
_"The law of nature is a law instilled by nature, in all creatures."_
Stoicism influence.

Stocism and Aristotle would both reject that there is a side of multiculturalism that casts certain people to be fundamentally different from other people that the two can hardly make sense to each other.
Fundamental unifying force according to which we have a shared psychology and a common humanity, which the law appeals to.

There is a great level of heterogeneity between different culture, and Rome was not convinced that level of heterogeneity rises to rationality itself, and therefore of all people, whatever their customs be, are fitful for the rule of law, and can be brought up to be worthy of the rule of law.

The debts of British Common Law, American Constitution, Napoleonic Codes, etc to the Roman law are apparent.
Our conceptions of justice, liberty, the dignity of the individual at least when the individual appears before the bars, are developments of a Greek philosophical foundation and Roman lawyers.

An orderly process in which a disinterested judge can weigh evidence, examine claimants and arrive at a judgment that is conformable not to the popular will but to reason and reasonableness.

### Augustine on Human Nature

St Augustine (354 - 430), the City of God, Confessions (what changed him, the sources of his confusion and his salvation in faith).

Laid the philosophical foundation for much of Christianity.
Studied Cicero. Professor of rhetoric at the imperial court in Milan, contemporary of St Ambrose.

Reflecting on the disciplined anti-intellectualism of early Christians: being skeptical about the ancient pagan's work on philosophy being the right guide, as he already has the right guide: the life and teaching of Jesus Christ.

The likelihood of success of a faith is greatly reduced if it has officially anti-intellectual attitudes.
A properous religion is usually promulgated by teaching, a set of practices performed by the intellectuals schooled in the way of the world.

Augustine recovers the philosophical wisdom of the ancient, and uses it to fortify the teachings of the church.

Ascent towards knowledge is impelled by a sincere love of God allowing one to reach heights otherwise unreachable.
True wisdom is nothing but fear of God.

Augustinian solution to the problems of evil, if God is all-loving, omniscient and omnipotent; if there is no free will, how can I be held accountable for what I do.

How do you know about God?
In most forms we know from experience. But having accepted God is immaterial, how can God be known to exist epistemologically at all?
Augustine takes a dialectical approach not unlike Plato's Meno.

You can perceive a square, but not a triliagon (thousand-sided), but you can conceive of (understand) one.
You are capable of knowing by conception, what you cannot know by perception.
And you can conceive of God although not perceive one.

### Islam

632AD, Mohammad, Quran.
Quran, though believed to be unchanged since conception (product of God), did evolve over time (excavation in Yemen).

The Prophet says each verse in the Quran has 7 meanings, the first is literal, the last is only known to God.

Islamic faith is at once a culture, an ethics, a mode of philosophical inquiry and a commitment to a reflective life.
That there are those who would fashion its teaching into hate and destruction is a painful development in recent history, making it difficult to evaluate the tradition itself and the respect it earned over the course of centuries.

The west may not have been able to recollect the Aristotelian and Platonic canon, without the work of Islamic scholars 10th C and onwards.

We are inclined to think 650 - 850 as Dark Age, because we see very little by way of philosophical development, critical thinking or originality, those produced by thought, argument, discourse and recorded in text.

The eastern world saw development, Byzantine preserved and promulgated much work from classical antiquity, and the Islamic world carried this on.
The early Islamic scholars put an Islamic spin on classical western political, natural scientific and philosophical writings. Inspired from the teachings of the Prophet.

Islamic philosophical inquiries in 10th, 11th and 12th C.
Al Farabi, reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thought with the teachings of the Prophet.
Avicenna, commentates on Aristotle Metaphysics. A means to demystify the natural world.

Eastern medicine traces back to Hipprocratic naturalistic / scientific approach.
Western medicine of the same time regards disease and disorders as symbols of sins.

The conquest of Islam enrolled the Islamic world in Greek classroom.

How does a religion solidify its position?
By developing an official set of canon and teachings that constitutes the way things are.

The medieval view on the world we live in is that ultimately it's a metaphor for another world eternal and changeless.

The greatest threat to the continuation of the great debate (on knowledge, conduct and governance) is **orthodoxy** (the right way to see things such that any other way is wrong): e.g. at the end of the day, faith is all that matters.
The debate becomes an insult to the faithful and the faith.
Too much philosophy weakens the faith.

What Islam achieved (or the challenge of Islam guaranteed), though it did not set out to do this, was that the long debate would be revived, that there is more than one book to consult, more than one set of prophecies and more than one prophet who was graced with the words of God.

The scholarly and contemplative life that the Quran requires of the faithful, is a life compatible with the long debate.

### Secular knowledge, the idea of university

800AD, Charlemagne, Holy Roman Empire.
Civic duties, rights of the (poor) people, promote teaching, reduce illiteracy, bring in teachers from England and Ireland, preservation of classical scholarship, Christianization.
Divine right of kings, court language Latin.

Alcuin, Latinist, Classicist, head of palace school, brought literacy to European clergy, abbey schools.

Seven liberal arts, Hugo of St Victor.
Initially the trivium: grammar, rhetoric and logic.
Then the quadrivium: arithmetic, music, geometry, astronomy.

Universitas, initially means a guild of students.
Cathedral of Paris abbey school, taught seven liberal arts.

University and the contemplative life.
The university back in the days had its practical functions, laws, rhetorics, grammar, medicine (somewhat similar to earlier trade schools in Bologna, Italy), but also a different set of scholarly objectives: lectures, debate on ideas and philosophical introspection.

University of Oxford.

The place that invents the methods of invention.

University, gothic churches, chivalry.

Chivalric knight as a secular priest, one who does God's bidding.
Politeness his strength, reserved and complete control of his emotions.
The only insult is an insult to honor.
Chivalry is a great civilizing influences in the history of western civilization.

### The reappearance of experimental science

Renaissance.
What was it that once was alive then died and reborn in Florence 14th Century.
Textbook's claim of classical ideals of ancient Greece and Roman is unsatisfying.
There was profound differences between Hellenic and Roman civilization and Florence in the 14th Century.

Rebirth of learning and classical thoughts of Plato / Aristotle is found more in Islamic and Greek scholars of 11th Century.

Abelard, Heloise, Sic et Non, revival of the philosophical program (on metaphysics, theology, ethics. Radical nominalism, universals are nothing but class names; radical realism, universals must be real as there otherwise can't be individuals that possess the relative attributes.).

Revival of experimental science.
Scientific achievements of the Hellenic world. Aristotle, Hippocrates, Theodorus of Samos, etc, are no stranger to sciences.

Robert Grosseteste, on Aristotle's ethics and physics, created an interest in science at Oxford.
Roger Bacon and experimental science, Opus Majus.

Scholasticism attempts to reconcile the Christian doctrines and Aristotelian logic.
The scientific inquiry becomes a mode by which we know God.
It's an obligation on the Christian conscience to know God, and to know God is to know God through his works, leading to scientific and naturalistic inquiries of nature.
Also an inquiry into our nature, because by way of imago dei, to know oneself is to know something of God.

Thomas Aquinas. Christian faith and the facts of natural science can't be in conflict as both reach the truth about the same creation.

Opus Majus.
_"I now wish to unfold the principles of experimental science, since without experience nothing can be sufficiently known. For there are two modes of acquiring knowledge, namely by reasoning and experience. Reasoning draws a conclusion and makes us grant the conclusion, but does not make the conclusion certain, nor does it remove doubt so that the mind may rest on the intuition of truth, unless the mind discovers it by the path of experience."_

Experimentation. Systematic, discplined observation, under conditions you have more or less control, so you are certain what you are looking at.
Roger Bacon's experiments includes decomposition of light into prismatic colors and making spectacles.
He comments on the sin of ignorance and the need for the clergy to be scientifically informed.

What's more important than finding, is the method of finding itself.

Dun Scotus, drawing generality from sensory observations, like a frequentist probability approach.

The labors of medieval scholarship, particularly within the context of the university, the corpus of scholastic teaching and thought, methodology, criticism and analysis will revive the tradition of the west.

Every age is confident in its perspective being the "modern" perspective.
When we get confident in our science and religion, that we have everything nailed down, move in front of a mirror and think "I may be hopelessly wrong", and in that, we may very well be right.

### Scholasticism and the theory of natural law

Thomas Aquinas, 13th Century, Doctor of the Church. Scholastic philosophy.
Catholic philosophy and natural law, regards Aristotle as "the philosopher".

Law as the expression of the rational order itself.

Summa Theologica. Like Sic et Non, begins with a question and presents the for and against.

His position on human nature: man is a composite of body and soul (hylomorphism).
On knowledge: differentiate the human and the divine intellect.
The human intellect functions as a whole.

Freedom of the will. If one can't choose reward and to avoid punishment, then reward and punishment would not work at all.
Man judges on the basis of the reason, apprehending what should be done. Upon which lies his basis on law.

Law is a rule and measure of acts whereby man is induced to act. The rule's first principle is reason.
Consistent with Aristotle's position on the generality of human nature.
Based on this nature, what kind of rule of law is right for entities of this kind?

Aquinas found Aristotle's treatise on virtue (episteme) lacking in the central Christian mission, to know the divine essence of God.

Salvation was not something Aristotelian Ethics need to do with, but Thomas Aquinas's work had to: the Christian sense of **charity**, sharing, sympathy, forgiving, exercising restraint and **faith**.

The problem of conduct to Thomas Aquinas is reconciliation with the eternal law.
To know God, love God, and become worthy of God's presence in the next life, none of these would be in Aristotle's teaching.

**Natural law theory** (similar to Aristotle, Cicero and Roman law):
_"The law is an ordinance of reason promulgated by one who has responsibility for the good of the community."_

Law appeals to the rational side of our essential nature, not a set of mechanical constraint.
Law is natural to creatures of a certain kind.
The right and just law demands what a rational being would demand of himself were there not competing influences.

The culprit is desire.
The pleasures of the moment temporarily trumps the rule of reason.

Responsibilities of parenthood, to the church, desire good and shun evil.

We develop the moral and intellectual virtues by study and contemplation.
We also must develop theological virtues so that the form of life we live matches up properly with the life of Jesus, one abundant in charity and the epitome of faith and divine providence that gave all hope to an eternal future that would cancel out the frustrations and disappointments of earthly life, and reward us for the commitment and devotion that we have made during those years of earthly life.

Thomas Aquinas's life turned away from writing. An examined life that found words incapable of expressing truths inherently known by the grace of God.

### The Renaissance - was there one?

Florence in the 1400s.
Feudal world to urban lives.

Alberti on architecture.
What it is about a city that makes it the right place to live: a place where we (organic and reasonable beings) learn lessons and realize possibilities.
Isolation of classes cemented by architectural division.

Pope Nicholas V. The Papacy became a center of Greek thought.

Bruni. History of Florence. Biographies of Aristotle, Cicero, Dante and Petrarch.

Petrarch. Letters of Cicero. Skeptical towards the ancient philosophers. Not quite recovering the ancient perspective.

Dante. Beatrice. Vita Nuova. to write of her as never before had been written of a woman.
Perfective love which he found in Scholastic philosophy.
The Divine Comedy. The last great Romance of high medieval.

Florentines thought of themselves as recovering the lost world view of the Athenian and Romans, which they thought devoted to humanizing and humanistic arts, centered around human nature and what was right for it.
Music, statue, architecture, poetry, song, drama, the secular life.
Humanists, humanistic studies.

School of Athens. Raphael, the secular knowledge. Medieval world view.

An age that looks in both directions at the same time.

Martin Luther, Bible translation into German. The rejection of Scholastic Roman Catholic Church and promotion of Evangelical Christianity.
Reformation of the pious life. Condemn Rome, try the Pope, reject his authority.

Erasmus. In Praise of Folly. Wrote with contempt against church's practices and stands.

The renaissance conception of virtue, compared with Aristotle's notion, is more external and publicly observable, e.g. patronage to artists.
There was no lack of patrons of arts and scholarly studies, the Medicis, Cosimo de Medici.

Renaissance produced no philosophers of abiding significance.
There were gifted teachers and translators, but not the defining feature of the Hellenic world: its philosophical power and originality of philosophy.
No Greek pagan's work was needed, to tell one how to live one's life.

### Witch prosecutions

Witch hunts of 1400s - 1700s does reflect the intellectual ethos of a period.
Witches were burnt well into times of scientific development, of Descartes, Newton and Galileo.

Every age has its witches, as well as a theory that confirms the fact that the targeted are the right ones.
Laws have long dealt with witches and witchcraft, and old ideas have great staying power when they play into our most cherished prejudices.

White witchery.
Ancient Roman Law prosecuted witches responsible for death of cattles, etc, who are judged based on the damage done, not about the sources of the power, just the act and its consequences.

Christian morals praise and blame are reserved for the actions one has control over. (Emphasis on moral freedom.)
Mens rea, intention to commit a crime: the mind itself must have been corrupted.

Power above nature has two sources, the God and the devil.
If the source of the witch's supernatural power is the devil, then it matters not what she does is minute or colossal, or for good or for evil.

In some Medieval courts, the defendant could choose trial, ordeal or compurgation (a person would be acquitted if X number of persons swear to God his innocence).
Not so for witch trials. The witch may have an advocate, who may face excommunication for defending the witch.

* The accusatorial procedure. Court acts on accusation. Defendant face accusers.
* The inquisitorial procedure. The court is actively involved in gathering evidence and investigating facts about the case (non-adversarial).

Malleus Maleficarum, treatise on witchcraft and demonology, claims to say there is no witchcraft is heresy.
Evidence includes
* tear test: not weeping upon hearing Bible verses that would make a good Christian weep, like Mary's love for his dying son.
* The floatation test: float the witch on blessed water. Sink: innocent. Float: rejected by the water and guilty.
* The pricking test: pricking the body to find where the devil left his mark.

We should realize how easily wrong-headed theory gaining support from undeveloped science can wreak misery and shame.
We must be careful with our theories.

### Francis Bacon and Authority of Experience

18th Century looked upon the science of Bacon and Newton in 17th Century as the source of their enlightenment.

Bacon was Lord Chancellor, later dismissed on bribery charge. A stylish writer. Moral and juridical essayist.
His time, the Elizabethan Age, was an expansionist and prosperous period. The queen was a patron of explorers and scientists.
Rival of Edward Coke. Common Law of England.

Bacon rejected the proposition that because an idea has been around for a long time, it somehow has proved itself.
Challenge of orthodoxies.

**Novum Organum** (the new method) of Bacon that has never been tried before: method of invention and discovery by experience. Experimental science.
Disciplined and systematic observations compiled and stored into "the table of discovery".
Pursuit of knowledge through the guide of experience, not the authority of texts. New epistemological view.

His view moved on from Aristotle and the ancient world.

Two kinds of experimental work,
* Experimenta lucifera. Light giving. Uncover the causal relationship in the natural world. _"Whatever deserves to exist, deserves to be known"_. No realm of inquiry is ruled out a priori. Create order out of chaos. Observe what there is. Modern times sometimes use "Baconian fact gathering" negatively, like directionless experiments.
* Experimenta fructifera. Fruit-bearing experiments. Bacon was not an impressive experimentalist himself.

Inspired from Bacon, Popper and falsifiability to assess scientific theory. No number of confirmation will confirm a universal law. Falsification is proposed instead of verification of universal laws.

Operations of the mind. The philosophy of humanity. Psychology.
In moral thought, ethics, civics Bacon's work followed the naturalist tradition of Aristotle. Man in the aggregate. Sociology.
In biological, medical fields, the Hippocratic tradition.

The New Method is not something new to the world.
Galen of 2nd Century had theories on how experiments should be conducted.

Bacon laid the foundations for a tradition to be relied on throughout the years to come, a clarity of the right method that the Scholastic period and Renaissance did not have.

_"Words are simply representatives of things in the external world. If you are interested in the external world, go in to that world. Don't sit around talking like a lover falls in love with a picture."_

In challenging orthodoxies, are we establishing new orthodoxies?

### Descartes and the authority of reason

17th Century.
Contemporary of Galileo and Bruno.
Jesuit school education. Founder of analytical geometry, philosopher, mercenary.
Father of modern philosophy.

_"I think therefore I am."_
Cogito, ergo sum.

Rules for the direction of the mind.

How does one find the right method that would spare one from self deception and superstition, but also from the melancholy state of a total skeptic?

* **Discourse on method**
* **Meditations on first philosophy**

_"The power of forming good judgment and of distinguishing the truth from the false, is by nature equal in all man. But to be possessed of good mental powers is not sufficient, the principle matter is to apply them well."_

What is the method of discovery? The guide to truth?
History? History is a guide, but not an answer. Men who spend so much time in distant lands become strangers in their own country. All that one can glean would be generality subject to disagreement.
Philosophy? Philosophers scarcely agree with each other on any major point.
Mathematics? Abstract tool of analysis that is not entirely clear if you can map it to physical reality.

For Descartes, the right method begins with a skeptical disposition: a profession of ignorance.
What I think I know is probably laden with error, misapprehension and confusion.

With this orientation, one is committed to accepting nothing, unless it can prevail on me as an idea of such power and clarity and indubitability, that I'm simply powerless to doubt it.
The analytical and axiomatic approach.

Anything that is not presented as an object of knowledge, e.g. objects of perception, could be delusion, and is not be accepted.
"My eyes are blue" (external to the mind) is subject to deception.
Thinking (as opposed to perception), however, is different.

_"Thinking is another attribute of the soul, and here I discover what properly belongs to myself. This alone is inseparable from me. I am, therefore, precisely speaking, only a thinking thing, that is mind, or reason"_.

"I think, therefore I am", is then an epistemological claim, a method by which to be sure of one is not deceived.
The necessary precondition even for total skepticism.

This method which begins with a thesis followed by good reasons that doubt its validity, then rational replies to the various objections, and the resting conclusion presented with clear and compelling force echoes with Sic et Non of medieval philosophy.
In this sense, he was the father of modern philosophy, as well as the last great scholastic philosopher.

* Accept nothing as true, accept what presents itself with a clarity and vividness that is irresistable.
* Divide each problem into steps as small as possible.
* Work from the solution of the smaller steps, then tackle the bigger problem and reach the general solution.
* Test the general solution with persistence. Try to falsify the general solution.

Philosophy of the mind (abstract, logical thoughts).
**The mind-body problem** then becomes central to Descartes, whose discrepancy Aristotle saw, but the ancient philosophers did not expand on.
How the immaterial, mental thing controls the moving, physical things?
Would it be possible that something about the body can cause the mind to think? No to Descartes.

Descartes, too, raises the question of whether it being possible to build a machine which would mimic our behavior so closely that we cannot tell it from a real person.

He claims no, as it would not attain the idea of God, it would not be able to frame abstract concepts, and it could not creatively use language.

The above would also be the marks of us rational and thinking beings: the rational, creative and discursive powers not at the level of perception, feeling or behavior, but rather the abstract and rational thought such as one sees in mathematics.

His take on the mind-body problem then becomes that the mind has an independent standing.

A theory of innate ideas. Something publicly and universally known cannot be known purely as a result of sensory experience, but some innate, intuitive, a priori mental power.
(If sensory experiences are all that occupy the mind and all knowledge of the external world are by way of the sensory organs, then all that we could possibly know are our own experiences, sights, sounds, tastes, odors, and there is no basis to assume there is an external material world that is causally bringing me sensations. Everyone does know that the sensations are caused by the external material world impinging on the sense, therefore the above-stated innate power exists: the idea of matter must be something immiment in thought itself.)

### Newton and science

1643 - 1727. Cambridge, Trinity College. Was taught Plato, Aristotle, law, theologies at school, and read Descartes, Kepler, Hobbs, Copernicus and Galileo.

**Certain philosophical questions**.
_"Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my best friend is truth."_
Derived his interest in maths from astrology.
Plague caused suspension of studies in Cambridge, and made the most genius discoveries.

Secular, forward-looking and analytically rigorous methods.
One not in the thrall of ancient wisdom or scholastic niceties.
Novel instruments, methods of mathematical analyses.
Model for succeeding generations of scientists. Remarkably productive.

Newton was profoundly interested in the scripture, not as utterly secular as 18th Century propaganda would have it.

**Principia Mathematica**
Universal gravitation, motion of bodies, mass of the sun, motion of the tides and stars.
Corrected Kepler's theory of motion.

Calculus. **Mathematized / quantified**, maths as an applied method in astronomy and dynamics, and as a mode of discovery.
The relation between maths and physics, obvious now because of Newton, but not to his predecessors.

Revolutionary change in understanding of science and methods.
We become knowledge gathering and theory testing entities.
Far more than just building on earlier observations (if on anyone, more on Galileo's foundational work than anybody else).

Reduce the complex problem. (ideal mass, abstract the object to a point.)
Introduced the idea to **simplify** to an ideal world which can be used to test theories and conjectures in the real world. The role of **the idealized model**. (The ancient Greeks did not view problems as collection of parts.)
Theoretical science at their best.

Interest in alchemy. Hundreds of pages unpublished on the subject.

A lifelong student of the bible, Newton believed the harmony and lawfulness he discovered were reflections of perfection of God's creation.
Seeing the compatibility between the scientific discovery and church's teaching were common for scientists of his time.

The Royal Society of London, on the account of no one's words.
The crown became patrons of scientists, it turns to science to investigate the claim of a woman giving birth to a sheep, whereas earlier clergyman would be sent instead.
Useful knowledge not enthralled by canon.

### Hobbes and the social machine

Thomas Hobbes, contemporary of Galileo, Newton, Descartes, of the beheading of Charles I, rise of the Lord Protector Cromwell, and restoration of monarchy.

Implication of developed science no Hobbes:
If all the universe can be reduced to systematic laws, then society itself can be embraced by the same rational approach to problem solving.

Authorative translation of Thucydides. Against radical democracy. Royalist.
Secretary to Francis Bacon, hence Baconian (and Galileo) influence.

**Leviathan**.
Social and civic engineering, minimize warfare / friction / civil strife.
Free will, determinism, and nature of human nature.

God has made nature conforming to the laws of mechanics, why should anything, society included, be different.
Eliminating absurdity from our thinking, Baconian challenge of ancient orthodoxies.

The approach of Hobbes is similar to that of Galileo's in physics, compositive and resolutive: breaking down complex phenomena into parts and building up again through systematic investigation.

Speech is central.
We engage in loose talk, and failed to distinguish real bodies, and material things.
Confusions are fundamentally grammatical and linguistic.
These are habits that must be relinquished, if there is going to be a scientific understanding of how society is to be structured and maintained.

The metaphorical mode of thinking Hobbes accused the scholastics to be guilty of, not the Hobbesian realist approach to civics.
Hobbesian reality is the physical reality.
Man is a material entity in a material world. Nothing transcendental.

Society is a collection of such entities. Complex system of matter and motion. Involuntary motion (instinctive and reflexive) and intentional motion (of motives and desires).

The root motives and desires are grounded in pleasure and pain, a hedonistic view in psychology.
The ultimate motive is survival, not eudaimonia, or eternal salvation.
Morally sound and virtuous life, is all about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain and (a violent) death.

Reduce reason itself to linguistic process, reducible to adding and subtracting, "reckon".

Man is by nature a self-defending, self-interested and selfish animal, not as Aristotle's view of social animal, and that self-interest is why man enters society.

It's not just by collectivizing that we gain security, rather when we enter society, we gain security by conferring upon someone, some group sufficient power and authority to be able to protect what we deem our own greatest interests.
Leviathan, the state, and our allegiance to it lasts as long as the state is capable of protecting us, our interest, and our life.
This is a long way from Aristotle's view of polis.

How can we reduce civil strife then?
By giving political power to the sovereign acting in the interest of the commonwealth.
The individuals within the commonwealth do not have equal power: _"the value or worth of a man is his price"_ (a person's worth his market value: what others are willing to pay for his power. Hobbesian "honor".)

On reward and punishment, the sovereign has such power, and it is in virtue of that power, we are moved.
Unless stopped by some impediment, we move towards reward and avoid punishment, that is what chivalry, honor, courage and duty are all about.
It is the sovereign with sufficient resources, making enjoying the pleasures of disobedience too heavy a price to pay.

A pernicious idea, but great nonetheless.

Hobbes critique of Descartes: the only thing we can know for certainty are physical material processes that are subject to observations and systematic scientific studies.
The ultimate ontology, is an ontology of matter.

### Locke's Newtonian science of the mind

John Locke (1632 - 1704, younger contemporary of Newton's): British empiricism and Newtonian psychology.
Trained as a physician. One of the few to be elected to the Royal Society for his philosophical contributions.

One of the most influential in modern history. Parliamentary pedigree, opposite to that of Hobbes's.

Scientific approach to the mind and the society.
Started with Bacon, featuring Locke, Hume, Mills, etc.

Newtonian science develops a simple model and then approach the physical problem through observation.

Newtonian science's ontology: begin with an assumption that the ultimate constituents of reality are not visible things but small corpuscular things (light, e.g., is made of such).
Complex phenomenons are to be resolved into elementary (atomic) components.

**Essay on human understanding.**
How the mind comes to be furnished at all?
He does not accept the theory of innate ideas, i.e. _"the soul received in its very first being"_.

Locke, however, does accept some original acts of the mind, e.g. the law of contradiction, and other forms of logic. **Intuitive knowledge**.
There are other undisputable truths in all cases, such as geometric proofs, but such has to be proven and requires an argument. This is **demonstrative knowledge**.

All ideas (the complex contents of human understanding) come from sensation (sensory acts / channels) or reflection, and in other words, from experience.

The thought experiment **Molyneux's problem**: a person born blind can feel the differences between shapes such as spheres and cubes, could he, after gaining sight, distinguish those by sight alone?
Locke's empiricism says no.

Complex ideas consists of elementary sensations, which are held together by an associational process like gravitation.
We learn by association. Those we experience frequently together become associated.

Locke then faces the skeptical challenges of how truthful the senses are.

**Dualistic epistemology** was found in Locke. Realist when we perceive certain objects in the world. Phenomenalist when it comes to other properties of the real world.

The lectern example. Its **primary quality**, hardness. What is there actually and can be reported by the sensory organs accurately. The hardness is made up from atomic elements that are hard.
The color is not: a brown lectern is not made up from atomic elements that are brown. This is a **secondary quality**, produced by that object but is not something in that object itself.

Locke also differentiates between two essences.
We do not have the perceptive power to know the corpuscular elements directly, and that is the **real essence** of an object.
The real elements of the object is what stimulates and brings about experience. On the basis of these experiences, we classify things (designate name to things, the **nominal essence**.)

This leaves room for skeptical claims of our knowledge: real world objects are mediated by sensations, and can never be known for what they really are.
One might challenge this with the claim that one really knows oneself. The cells in my body are ever being replaced, but my identity does not change, what is the essence of self?

Plutarch says the ancient philosophers argued about the same thing: over time **Theseus's ship** are reinforced with new planks: at what point is it no longer considered Theseus's ship?

Locke regards self / personal identity as a collection of experiences, memories, held together by the process of associations.

Scriblerians, including Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, attacked this theory, as philosophy ran amock: Jack kills Bill and by the time Bill hits the ground he is already a different person when attacked by Jack, and you can't even have a court trial on this.

### The challenge of materialism

The mind-body problem.

No matter, never mind. Classic materialist position.

No mind, never matter. The material world presupposes a thinking entity.

Locke's radical empiricism seems to underestimate the creativity of the mind.
**Tabula rasa theory**: men are born blank slate and all knowledge came from experience.

Leibniz. Calculus, statesman, probability theory, rationalist philosopher.

**New essays on human understanding**. Challenges Locke's empiricism.
Leibniz interprets Locke as "nothing is in the mind at all, except what is first in the senses". From Medieval Scholasticism of Duns Scotus.
Leibniz's point would be, "except intelligence itself".

It's not just a collection of sensations pulled together to form elementary ideas, then complex ideas.
Rather, there can't be a mind that's empty: mind is an integrative, creative, collective set of powers. The mind, self-awareness, self-reflection pre-exists experiences.

Thought experiment: make a device like this, but make it huge, what would you see?
Leibniz would claim you can find machinery, but not a perception or an idea.
All perceptional experiences are **qualia**, the actual feel of things, and cannot be found in the machine shop.
Reality is not reducible to crude matter.

This is the **rationalist** rebuttal of empiricism: mind is active.
Perception is grounded in apperception, or self-reflecting power.
A materialist reductionist strategy is not going to work.

Bishop George Berkeley (Barclay), optics, mathematician, philosopher, immaterialism, critique of materialism and skepticism. Berkeley the university is named after him.

If a tree is to fall and no one is there to hear it, does its fall make a sound?
**A treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge.**

Materialism is a fatally flawed explanation.
Distinction between contents of my mental life and myself that is I know these to be in my mind.
There are no de-personalized ideas. Every idea is someone's idea.

So long as they are not actually perceived by me, or do no exist in my mind or that of any other created spirit, they must have no existence at all or subsist in some mind of an eternal spirit.
No primary, secondary qualities like Locke's.

Yet the world remains as it's always been, it's not a fiction or a figment, it's filled with all the properties seen and experienced.
His thesis does not undermine the physical mechanical principles. The laws of science are summaries of experience, their reduction to a set of rules does not constitute the discovery of some real unperceived cause.

**_"esse est percipi"_**: to be is to be perceived.

Does the dark side of moon exist then? Or the peak of the tallest mountain yet to be climbed?
The material world subsists in the mind who made it, but it also subsists in its parts and particulars of those who have experience of the world.
No mind, no matter.

### Hume, psychologizing morality and causation

David Hume (18c), central figure in Scottish Enlightenment.
Contemporary of Rousseau, Adam Smith, etc. Celebrity in the salons of Paris, great conversationalist.
One of the most important writers to have written in the English language.

A period of great achievement in Scottish law, medicine, economics, art, scholarship, science.
Edinburgh Athens of the north.
(Adam Smith, etc are of the same period.)

**History of England**, 5 volumes.

**Treatise of Human Nature**, 3 volumes. Profound though regarded by Hume as immature work. Set out to defeat skepticism. But Hume earned his reputation as a skepticist.
**An enquiry concerning the principles of morals**.

Stoic teaching.

Moral philosophy of Hutcheson (British sentimentalist tradition), counters Hobbes with the constitutive nature of our being, having core sentiments that establish what we value, e.g. benevolence.
Naturalized moral theory, not abstract or transcendental.

Hutcheson takes a religious ground, and Hume takes an entirely naturalistic perspective.

Philosophy is not outside the human condition, it's part of the human condition.
Hume is influenced by Bacon and Berkeley's empiricism, and argues that the mind consists of sensory organs, and the external world makes sensory impressions on the mind.

There is some external physical world capable of exciting senses, but contents of the mind are just copies of what's occurring at the level of sensation.
We never have immediate knowledge of the external world, but only via this intermediary namely our perceptual capabilities. The naturalization of epistemology and morals.
This view has a shard of skepticism in it.
Hume has a Darwinian view of the external world, and this was before Darwin's time.

Hume is dubious about causes: the basis upon which we can ever know about causes.
Core principles of (Locke's) association: repetition is a principle of association (when A and B occur together often enough.)
Causation is then what the mind assigns to constantly conjoined experiences.

_"anything may be the cause of anything."_
Point being, the concept causation are habitual mental processes, not something recorded in the external world.
Psychologized causality (and morality).

Hume ties morality to the constitution of our (common) nature.

Maximization of pleasure and minimizing pain.
Hume is not skeptical about morality, but would reject all forms of moral realism.
Hume claims what we are maximizing here is "utility", among the first to use this term. "Utilitarianism".

Reason then becomes the deliberative means of securing what the appetite and passions require.

This does not sound controversial in that we are children of Humes: the essential function of government are in utilitarian terms, and the world as we know it is created by our mental machinery (and not God).

Hume's problem of induction: future has no obligation to mimic the past, and any inference we make about the future based on past experience has no rational warrants.

### Thomas Reid, the Scottish School

Thomas Reid. Common sense philosophy. Willingness to live by his own philosophy. Contemporary critic of Hume.
Master of optics, maths and astronomy.
Scottish thought was profoundly influential in the founding of the US.

An inquiry into the human mind. 1764.
In any significant conflicts between the dictates of common sense and the productions of philosophical imagination, it is the latter which has to yield.

The principle of common sense, not the prevailing opinion of the crowd or settled ethos of a community, but rather that which we have an obligation to take for granted, in all of the ordinary affairs of life.
Necessary preconditions for thought and action.

The prevailing theory, of Locke and the scholastics before him, had been that the external world cannot be directly known, but rather mediated through our senses (and presented to us as copies).
Reid found this idea and how it was reached worrisome.
Example: visual perception of rectilinear triangle projected onto a spherical surface.
Reid intends to take a Baconian / Newtonian experimental approach in this matter, as opposed to theorizing to which philosophers are prone.

Reid rejects Hume's theory on causation.
Conjoined events may be not causation, just correlations.
No set of observations or events taking place in the external world, could possibly lead to a concept like A causes B.
The concept of causation is an inference we make, based on our knowledge of ourselves as having an active power to do something. (Us having the power such as closing our eyes and darken the world, and projecting this power onto the world is how causation came about.)

On Hume's moral theory that passion rules reason, Reid does not think we are pleasure-seeking pain-avoiding organisms, rather we are rational entities first, and seek benefits in the long run or benefit us as a whole.

Psychological theory of morality.
Belief that our actions are in our power.

An artificial language must be grounded in a natural language (facial expressions, sounds you find in the animal kingdom).

On personal identity, Reid does not think it a collection of memories (Locke), or a bundle of perceptions (Hume).

_"Conjectures and theories are the creature of men, and will always be found to unlike the creature of God. A just interpretation of nature is the only sound philosophy Orthodoxy."_
Whatever we add of our own, is of no authority.

### France and the Philosophes

_"My works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is the one true mistress."_
Leonardo da Vinci

Similar thoughts can be found in Voltaire: the light of experience casts sufficient illumination for us to understand to the nature of our difficulties, and guide us out of the labyrinth.

Voltaire traveled to London and wrote on the English people, on Newtonian vs the Cartesian systems.

If philosophy has a purpose in human life, presumably it should be to help us figure out problems of essentially civic, social, moral and intellectual nature.
In this sense, the French salon Philosophes invited the world to the long debate.

For everything God gives us, he takes two things back.
With democratizing of philosophy, comes the populist and rhetoricals.

**Diderot's Encyclopédie**.
Utter secularization of knowledge. Authority of experience, science and common sense over traditional modes of authority, e.g. that of church.

d'Alembert, Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Holbach et al all contributed to Diderot's work, which perhaps served as the best material for public education since Charlemagne's time.

Voltaire. Like Descartes, was educated by Jesuits. Served in the Bastille for criticizing government, and later exiled to England. Admires the English people.

If a thing exists, it exists in some degrees. It can then be measured. If it can be measured, it can be known.
Enthusiam for calculus, all forms of machinery.

Rousseau. On the peripheral of glittering wits / fashionable salons. Tortured and misunderstood person, and paranoid towards the end of his life.
Against the attention to science and technology, Rousseau looks to nature in the raw, unanalyzed. Spare the resolutive and compositive methods of the tickering classes.
Against the vaunted rationalism of the Enlightenment, its contempt for superstitution and reverenece for high civilization, Rousseau draws his attention to the inauthentic lives constrained and corrupted by civilization.
The romantic rebellion. Same tool of high culture and literature astuteness that is the hallmark of the Enlightenment.

**Rousseau's Emile**, on Education, civilization works to the disadvantage of what is most authentic about us. The process of civilizing someone is to strip him of natural tendencies and sentiments. It hardens and renders indifferent its beneficiary.
Against traditional authority.

**The Social Contract** 1762, _"Man is born free, and he is everywhere in chains. One thinks oneself the master of others and still remains a greater slave than they. How did this come about."_
The chained mind by orthodoxy and rendered incapable.
Naturalism and a concession to nature. Skepticism towards habitual modes of conduct and human contrivances.

**La Mettrie and Man a Machine**. Physician. A polemic.
_"it is not enough for a wise man to study nature and truth. He should dare stay truthful for the benefit of the few who are willing and able to think. As for the rest, who are voluntarily slaves of prejudice, they can do no more than a frog can fly."_
Claims man is a complicated machine. The soul is an enlightened machine, still a mechanical contrivance.

Translation of Locke in French.
The sentient statue.

Helvetius. Environmentalist.

Condorcet. Sketch for a historical picture of the human mind. Hopefulness in the union of the sciences and the society.
Integral calculus, probability and decision theory. Secretary of the Academy. Revoluntionary. Died in prison.

18th Century claimed revival of the classics, but not quite compatible of the classical world view, one of harmony and propotion, everything has its place and function, a search for the absolute and everything good can be preserved.
The idea of progress in the 18th Century, however, suggests what is stationary is stagnant, and the future is under no obligation to mimic the past. Liberate human imagination.

### Federalist papers and the great experiment

The Federalist papers, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay notes on the proceedings of conventions of founding fathers (delegates of various states), confidential initially to the media. 1787 draft, 85 letters published under the name "Publius".
Designed chiefly to win New York to the ratification of the constitution.

Political philosophy contribution with realistic and practical wisdom.
A set of templates for a national government, compared with the work of the contemporary Rousseau, (and earlier) Locke, Hume, Montesquieu, etc, on whose work the authors are well read.

Hamilton proposed president for life with veto power, which seemed nearly tyrannical.
Madison was a key figure to the constitution and American politics. Reformed Princeton's curriculum, from where he graduated.
Promulgater of Scottish common sense philosophy. Naturalist, scientific and progressive.

Madison answers **"what is a republic"**: when government's power is derived entirely from its people.
_"When it is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure for limited period or during good behavior"_. (serve at the people's pleasure and required to uphold standards of conduct acceptable to those who are governed.)

The closer something comes to approximating this sense of the republic, the sooner it dies.
Those who it make are puritanical republic: power is delegated by the people, not held and wielded by them.
A republican system of this sort can _"refine and enlarge public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations."_

And a critical number of representatives must be elected, for the smaller the number, the greater the opportunity for cabals.

In Federalist Papers, Hamilton's critique on Montesquieu demonstrates a general suspicion towards theoretical ways of solving practical problems.
The tension between the two arises from the need for a central government able to secure the finances and defenses of the nation, and the jealously guarded freedom of the individual states.
What is the difference between paying taxes to the British, vs paying taxes to a government within the national boundaries. Is one tyranny being replaced with another?

The point of a constitution is to constitute a nation, to give it centrality. 
_"The federal and state governments are in fact different trustees of the people, constituted with different powers, designed for different purposes...The ultimate authority resides in the people alone, and that it will not depend merely on the comparative ambition and the address of different governments."_

Montesquieu: despotism - the required disposition is fear, monarchy - honor, republican - cultivation of virtue. Natural aristocrats by character, not by birth.

Madison discusses the failed republics of Greece and Rome, lifetime senate appointments, the tendency of citizens to misplace their interest under the enthusiam of the moment.
_"As the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free governments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers; so there are particular moments in public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn."_

Human nature can be occasionally fickle, foolish, and gullible. The right form of government cannot rid human of such nature, but can control them long enough for a person to engage in the lifelong mission of self correction.

The Federalist Papers demonstrated an utter respect by the authors for the people whose allegiance they seek to cultivate.
The Federalist Papers achieved philosophy with a civic face. Citizens need to take himself and his missions seriously. All passion spent, self governance is risky business, and power without virtue is a sure path to a life without a point.

What sort of virtue is needed in this republic?
Opinions of the founding fathers differ, but agree on this experiment on self governance presupposes an instructed population, products of a good education with a point, and the point being the development of citizens.
The responsible, informed, inner-directed, virtuous person. A matter of character, not of vocational or professional skills.
And that character is forged by observing good example, and public education, which Jefferson thought to be the foundation of this.

A worthy government works to create virtuous, self-governing citizens, whose efforts are a lifelong labor.

### Enlightenment and Kant on freedom

What can I know? What ought I to do? What can I hope?
Questions to which Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804) devoted most of his adult life. Empiricist.

Immanuel Kant: what is enlightenment? **Intellectual freedom**. Express one's own ideas rather than echo'ing the thoughts of others.
_"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."_
The freedom to question, to make public use of one's reason in all matters.

**Critique of pure reason**: not criticizing but analyzing the assets and limitation of its subject, pure reason, i.e. nature and limits of reason itself.
Where reason trails off, what else is there and what can we hope for? (Knowledge)
Kant claims to have awakened from his dogmatic absorption in David Hume, and thus this work.
Hume: everything we know is product of experience. Causation, habitual mode of all action.
Kant agrees, but claims it's a mistake to assume because our knowledge **arises from** experience, that our knowledge **is grounded in** experience.
But in terms of Hume's causation, we cannot see or feel time, there cannot be succession / conjunction unless time is present as a categorical framework for all experience.

Time is a necessary precondition for temporal ordering, but not given by any experience, i.e. time is not a stimulus on sense organs or learned through experience.
Cognitive holdings that are not results of experience are what Kant deemed **"pure" / non-empirical**.
This critique deals with such cognitive holdings such as time.

Space as such is also not given by experience, but also something that is present for there to be experience at all.

Thus, Kant thinks time and space pure "intuitions", i.e. a priori to all experiences as described by Hume.
Causation then is not just a habit of the mind, but must be grounded in something more foundamental, that which experience itself cannot convey.
All of epistemic claims have certain forms of properties, that they all take place in some categorical framework such as time and space.

The analytics of concepts: Kant claims all knowledge involve some judgment, formed within a universal categorical framework.

Such categories (of human understanding) involve
* Quantity (one, many, all; unity, plurality, totality. Nothing about the senses can convey totality, such as the number infinity cannot be learned by counting.)
* Quality.
* Modality (something is actually the case, possibly the case, or necessarily the case. Experience also cannot convey necessity.)
* Relation.

Kant argues the above categories are not just what our minds use to describe experiences / particularity of our nerve systems, but rather necessary frameworks / forms for all epistemic framework within which there can be understanding / experience.

**Hume's fork**: two classes of things we can know about, relations among ideas vs matters of fact.
All bachelors are unmarried, is an example of the former. **Analytical propositions**, whose truth can be known entirely independent of experience, i.e. known a priori. 
Bill is wearing shoes, is an example of the latter. **Synthetic propositions**, whose truth cannot be known prior to the experience / a priori.

Kant's rebuttal on the above is by pure intuitions of space and time. All empirical statements we make will have certain properties that can be established a priori, by way of the pure intuitions of time and space, and pure categories of understanding.
Hence a part of that synthetic proposition can be known a priori: you experience takes place in some framework.

In a sense, the Kantian pure intuition and categories are prerequisites for Hume's experience to work.

What we know of the external world factually takes the form of phenomena, objects of perception.
But there is something behind this realm of phenomena (Kantian **realm of noumena**), and the question is how accurately does the mental representation of reality we have reflect the actual reality?
We cannot penetrate the phenoma to the noumenal level, and this places a limit on what we can know, and the validity of knowledge we can claim.

**Critique of practical reason**: grounding of ethics. Principles by which choices are made among morally weighty consequences. (Conduct)
Kant's moral theory shows influence from Reid.

**Critique of judgment**: grounding of aethestics. (what is harmonious, what is apt, etc)

All three works are difficult in German or English.
Kant was not well-traveled, and is said to be a well-humored and affable person, not in his philosophical work though.

### Moral science and the natural world

Hume's moral theory: our moral reasoning are based on sentiments, emotions and utility.
Ground on which we judge good or bad is not some abstract moral concept, but how the certain events affect us cellularly / physiologically.
_"Moral distinctions not derived from reason."_
**Moral matches up with utilitarian pleasure, with roots extending back to Epicureanism. Utilitarianism**

Events are judged bad only because we react to them that way (generally based on their utility, pleasure).

Moral philosophy is then not to deduce first moral principles, but to come to grip with human nature, and to recognize the challenges that nature faces, in a complex world.


Kant's moral theory: **deontological theories**, deon, duty in Greek. A principal adversary to utilitarianism.

Certain moral precepts are unconditional. Certain actions are right or wrong under whatever circumstances.
Utilities, sentiment, and emotions are irrelevant.
Deontological theories reject the idea that something is right because it happens to achieve good outcomes, or in your heart you know it's right.

The fact that humans are natural objects does not imply that they are no more than this.
Human beings are also rational beings: they occupy the intelligible realm, in which we account for events not due to physical causes, but rather reason.

Other aspect of Kant's moral theory: **autonomy of the will**: there is no moral at all if we don't have the freedom to act or not act.
There must be sufficient freedom for us to be charged of wrongdoing, or praised for virtuous actions.

Kant claims the above cannot be proved empirically.
In **Critique of Practical Reason**, Kant claims our conscious awareness of a moral law grants a concept of freedom. There are such moral laws, as otherwise the concept of freedom would not be intelligible. The means by which the concept of freedom is reached is rational, not empirical, and cannot be proved scientifically.
A scientific proof (on atomic determinism), in a sense, is contrary to the idea of freedom (autonomous and subject to moral laws).

An automous person, in Greek, is not a lawless person, but rather whose freedom is governed by the laws he gives himself.

_"A free will and a will subject to moral laws are one and the same."_

**Hypothetical imperative** (hunger, thirst, frustration, Humian desires): if you were to achieve this specific outcome, then you must do that.
Grounded in our natural being where we are subject to the natural laws of science.

To contrast with hypothetical imperative, Kant proposes **categorical imperative**: an action being objectively necessary in itself, without any other purpose, i.e. without any other end.

Goal of happiness cannot be obtained by willing it, the required virtue is prudence. 

And what Kant sets up to say here is that Humian moral theory is really concerned with things that are outside morality, i.e. the hypothetical imperatives, without moral freedom. This is somewhat similar to Aristotle's view.

Kant's moral precepts are universally applicable. They carry with them categorical imperative, which asserts its own moral authority, not based off of some consequences.

On Kant's account, infants, or one whose nerves are flawed in such sense (insanity), are not moral beings, as they don't possess rationality.
Then under the same account, an insane person (or one lacking the authority of the will) is not among those fit for the rule of law, and is not subject to moral law.

The categorical imperative, summarized as _"act in such a way that the maxim of your action (i.e. the principle upon which your action is based), would (if you were able) be instituted as a universal law of nature"._

_"Man is never means to an end, but an end in themselves."_ Kant uses this to propose to never lie.

(John Stewart Mill would claim Kant's argument can justify an insane arsonist establishing burning all as a universal precept, though this would appear to derive from misunderstanding Kant's argument.)

Kant's epitaph, "the moral laws within him, and the starry sky above him".

Kant's moral theory, not for pleasure, or easing pain, but for doing the right thing, and thus instantiating ourselves as moral beings.

### Phrenology

Enlightenment also saw revival of atomic theory, corpuscular science of Newton's.
The mindset then was optimistic: no problem is so complex as to beyond the reach of science.
They would argue to discover the nature of human nature, one must understand the subject to be a scientific one of the brain.
Phrenology is one such study.

Lavater and Physiognomy: maps one's face to one's character.

Franz Joseph Gall, father of phrenology.
The theory would claim, e.g. one can judge all talents by observing physical appearance, or a surgeon can gauge one's cranial skull to learn one's morals, characters, etc.
The Church banned this school of thought which led to atheism.

Goethe, Edison also held phrenology beliefs.

Gall received best medical education of his time, was not a charlatan, and did research on fetuses to study phrenology.
Gall also differentiated brain grey and white matters, a functional anatomy of the brain. A pioneer in comparative structural anatomy.

(Phren, Greek for mind. Gall claims this to be the incontestable truth of the science of the mind).

Gall identified 27 basic faculties of the mind, each associated with a specific organ of the brain. (a modular theory of the mind；e.g. one's destructiveness is somewhere above the ear. Understanding of causality somewhere in the forehead.). Later comers added more.
Gall also claims heavier brain mass indicates higher faculty in aspects.
Gall claims mental and moral differences between people trace back to differences in structure of the brain.
Experience matters, but the ultimate factor is genetic, like Hesiod's men of gold, bronze and iron.

Later critics of phrenology performed experiments where brains of an animal were cut open, certain areas removed, and the animal is sewn back together to observe what deficiencies they have.

Phrenology, although pseudo-scientific, contributed to rescuing philosophy of the mind from being speculative to physical and clinical sciences.
The theory died in the second half of the 20th century.

### Romanticism

Romanticism of the 19th C.

Even though it may be a rejection, or a reaction to enlightenment, it traces back to enlightenment.

Rejecting superstition, reserving experience alone as the final authority, nature at the center of philosophical concerns.
Nature of law, human, belief, government, the world and the cosmos.
Against the authority of scripture or revelation, rank and title, over-analytical scholasticism, sloppy acceptance of canon.

Rousseau, a religion of nature. Liberate perception.
**Reveries of a Solitary Walker**. Merging with fields and flowers.

Kant's view contrasts the proposal of Rousseau's:
If systematic observation on which science depends reveals only phenomenal reality and not Kant's noumenal reality, then science has built in limitations, and may be another obstacle to the truth of things.
Human nature, the intelligible realm, cannot be adequately understood by the causation order of the sciences, but only through the rational introspective thoughtful being who discovers himself a being with free will.
The way to get behind the observations, is then through this freedom.

Consider Gothic novels like Frankenstein and the Castle of Otranto, or Fuseli's Nightmare. Romanticism conveys the sense of the mystery behind the reality, that gets uncovered through art and literature.

Romantic rebellion against the line and angle precision, and the pretension to knowledge of the scientific community, the mixed bounty of a industrial revolution that began as a servant but now stands as a master of the human condition.

Goethe, painter, botanist, playwright, poet, statesman. Romanticism.
**Farbenlehre**, long book on color vision. Critique on the Newtonian theory of light as an experience.
Goethe takes a step back and examines the perception of beauty. Perception have inventive powers, and can defy physics.
What defines human nature would not be the rigidity of science.

**Faust**, two parts, the optimistic Goethe had him saved by angels.
Dr Faustus, 15c, a magician, alchemist, knowledgeable, studious, gentleman, to whom life has lost its meaning, he knows everything, master of scripture. Made a deal with the devil to possess supernatural knowledge and power.
Goethe's version has a wager between God and Satan, and Faust's devotion to religion was replaced with devotion to science. Yet all his studies has not revealed the truth to things.
Love, power, romance, passion, ocean of turmoil and possibilities. What would you sell your soul for? Mephistopheles.

_"He only earns his freedom and existence who daily conquers them anew"_.
Faust, the man who went through everything, placed this ideal of freedom at the highest.

Schiller. **Letters Upon The Aesthetic Education of Man**. _"Man is never so authentically himself than when at play"_.
Romanticists are well read in classics.
Eudaimonia, divinity within us expresses itself most fully when what we are doing, we are doing for the sheer intrinsic worth of the activity itself, not for anything external to it.
Authenticity of play.
In a sense, to professionalize an activity, is to transfer it from play to business.

Romanticism is about passion, the authentic commitment, not a gift of reason. What we do when we are free, and what we do to be free.
In play, we discover our authentic self.
Go through a world of wonder, wondering.

### Hegel and history

Classicicism vs romanticism world views.

Born 1770, geared for unexciting theological studies. German romantic idealism.
Defender of freedom, rejecton of the past. German ideology being influenced by the French revolution.

**The Phenomenology of Spirit (Mind)**
His mission: _"the systematic development of truth in scientific form can alone be the true shape in which truth exists. To help to bring philosophy nearer to the form of science – that goal where it can lay aside the name of love of knowledge and be actual knowledge – that is what I have set before me."_

Hegel acknowledges Descartes to be the thinker who revived the very foundation on which philosophy is based: knowledge in all its forms is but the unity of thought and being. Universal doubt as an absolute beginning. Make abolition of all determinations the first condition of philosophy.

Rejection of mechanistic sciences.
Hegel admires Newton's work, but also thinks Newtonian science makes Locke's philosophy nearly official: the pursuit of perceptual modes of knowledge, and shunning of deep metaphysical considerations are product of Newtonian science mode of thinking. Physics, beware of metaphysics; science, beware of thought.

Thoughtless application of thought itself may confuse us that we have witnessed reality as such, when in reality we merely recovered the product of a method.
The true is the whole, and there are no parts of truth.
Hegel also claims science doesn't actually explain anything: they describe what is, but not why things are the way they are.

Hegel (Fichte)'s triad **thesis, antithesis, synthesis**. (Dialectical method of Hegel, first idea, second idea that rejects the first, and third idea that reconciles both). Progress through conflict, reality arising through opposing tendencies. Freedom arises from such conflicts: in the attempt to constrain yourself, you become conscious of your freedom.
Ultimate reality is that of idea. The starting point of philosophy being the transcendental ego.

Explanations based on causes vs explanations based on reason.

Romanticism contains nothing if not the idea of struggle, which produces newer and ultimately better forms of thought.

History. Are we to assume these are accidental set of occurrences, or does it patently point to a plan or a scheme of some kind? Progressive development of an evolutionary nature.
There is reason in human history. **Reason in History**. History is a creation by reason.
The Absolute idea is the identity of the theoretical and practical idea. All else is error, confusion, caprice, transitoriness. The Absolute idea itself is being, all-knowing, truth.

Hegel's political philosophy, _"the state is the realization of the ethical idea, the true state is the ethical whole and the realization of freedom. The state is the march of the God through the world."_

Fichte, German nationalism, preserve German cultural ideology in the face of the French challenge.
Moral development of the human race.
The stage of perfected sinfulness, acting for the sheer sake of expressing freedom against any ground of constraint, opposition or coercion.
Only when one abandons individuality, which is materiality itself, can there be an eternal life.

### The aesthetic movement

The divorce between natural philosophers and the scientists. (1862, Helmholtz)
Hegel was vehemently against natural philosophers, and almost accused Newtonian science being narrow minded, and scientists accused philosophers being insane.

The aesthetic movement in late 19c.
A humanitarian century of reforms, removal of obstacles and saving people from traditional patterns of oppression.
A century that concerns itself with the discriminated groups and those who were not able to care for themselves.
Radicals, emancipation of slaves, centiments of benevolence.

Now, in a scientifically knowledgeable period with the right methods and perspectives, we could actually solve problems.

Romanticism sees science's understanding of nature is incomplete and too narrow, the Hegelians were on to something when they claimed science provided correct but empty equations, and it doesn't give us the reason of things.

Romanticism would have us see through art, beauty, poetry, that we come to realize our essential nature. And through understanding of that nature, ever more aware of the kind of world we should strive to bring about.

Aestheticists claim the fundamental connection between truth and beauty.

Science vs culture.
Should higher education teach Latin and Greek, or scientific methods?

James Mill.

Matthew Arnold, advocate of culture, "to know the best that has been thought and said about the world", also, Plato's world view would be strange nowadays, nonetheless, the nation's best interest may not be secured by a scientific education. To understand human nature, you can take a biological approach and keep tracing back. Keep going long enough, taking the scientific reductive approach, and good things can happen.
The way of culture is different: we are summoned to examine the achievements of humanity under favoring conditions. Take a look at what it creates when it took itself most seriously. A virtual addiction that I am not complete ever, the perfecting of lives through examples. Culture provides such examples, through drama, literature, art.
The whole point of classical study, or the aesthetic movement, is not to prepare for the life of a book reviewer, but rather to prepare for the life of a rational being.
The whole point of culture is to make a rational being more rational, to achieve "sweetness and light".
On culture and America. Its political system is meant for its people. The problem with US isn't power or wealth, it's that it's uninteresting: what makes a nation interesting is its capacity to inspire awe, through the creation of beauty.

Harrison. What makes England great is coal. (Not Shakespeare, Locke, Marlowe, etc)

John Ruskin. Architecture / art critic. The Stones of Venice. Appreciation of the Gothic.
Man is never so authentically himself than when at play (Schiller), and one of the great productions of play, is art itself. The authentication of human nature is found in its aesthetic enterprises, not its mechanical, routine, servile undertakings.

Oscar Wilde. The birth of America was the death of art. The idea and the practical.

### Nietzsche

Two ways of influencing philosophy:
* Rigorously analytical, built on foundation of logic, indebted to Aristotle and Plato.
* By way of aphorism, wise personal penetrating reflection on the meaning of all things philosophy deals with. Broadly atmospheric.

If the object of philosophy is the search for truth, then Nietzsche's _"what are man's truth ultimately? Merely his irrefutable errors"_, or _"my concept of the philosopher is worlds removed from any concept that would include even a Kant, not to speak of academic ruminants and other professors of philosophy"_.

Nietzsche, 1844 to 1900. Troubled life. Syphilis that may have resulted in madness. A dark, radical, luminary with style and ingenuity.
Democratization of knowledge is deeply underway. There aren't many periods in history in which Nietzsche would gain a publisher, or a reader base.

Attempts to anchor humanity to a fixed star, moral, or aesthetical, illustrates what Nietzsche judged to be the source of philosopher's failure: lack of historical sense.
In the universals they seek for, they think of man as constant, but given person is only a product of conditions under which one finds him.

Nietzsche had two different estimations of Schopenhauer.
Schopenhauer's subjectification of knowledge: _"the world is my idea. No truth is more absolutely certain than that all that exists for knowledge, and, therefore, this whole world, is only object in relation to subject, perception of a perceiver--in a word, idea."_ was a starting point for Nietzsche.

As is, the primary basic aim is self preservation, the will to live.

In time, Schopenhauer's influence on Nietzsche wanes, the will to live transformed to the will to power.
Ziegfried, the Nibelungenlied, the will to power, lusty unconventionalism.
We are destroyers. The will to power manifests through destructions.

**The Birth of Tragedy** contrasts the Apollonian and Dionysian, the two faces of the Greek world. (Dionysian enthusiamos, to be willing to be possessed by something. Ecstasis, to be removed from oneself.) Dionysian madness within Apollonian plot.

_"Socratic ethics, dialectics, the temperance and cheerfulness of the pure scholar could be viewed as the symptoms of decline, fatigue, distemper. Might it be the inquiring mind terrified by pessimism and trying to escape from it."_

Ardent admirer of Wagner. Both were influenced by Schopenhauer, and seeking to restore in art what it had lost to the concession to reasonableness.
Parsifal by Wagner. Wagner was anti-semitic.

Ubermensch, one who will overcome man, or a life of comfort, staying out of trouble, the society of servile, mechanically living people whose lives are empty, pointless sets of distractions.

**Thus said Zarathustra**: I teach you the Overman (Ubermensch). Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?
What is ape to man, a laughing stock, and man shall be just that, to the Overman.
Once the sin against God was the greatest sin, but God died, to sin against the earth is now the most dreadful sin. What is the greatest experience you can have? It is the hour of the great contempt, the hour when your happiness, virtue and reason arouse your disgust.

Nietzsche doesn't think himself or Wagner the overman, the closest one was Goethe, life authentically lived, utterly faithful to one's vocation.

Nietzsche's view on progress. The cheerful aspect of evolutionary forces, is but another myth, whose central mechanism is destruction, creation is always at the expense of destroying something else. Every creative act has to destroy.

Nietzsche declares the body of Judeo-Christian beliefs religions of servitude and guilt, and himself the anti-Christ.
He then had a scandalous depiction of Jesus, a naive child-like figure, very much akin to Dostoyevsky's idiot.
That the Christian concept of the other cheek, helping those in need, are rehearsals to keep people in their place, to set a limit on the expression of their feelings.
Nietzsche finds Judaism worse.

One finds in Nietzsche rejection of all comforting superstitions, the prospect of actual suffering is almost a goal.
Self loathing, the torture of mistrust, and the misery of him who is overcome have to take place in life, for one to realize oneself to be in the thrall of an inauthentic theater piece, scripted by others. One has not yet began to live the life of man.

One has to realize that loving relationship, or faithful friendship has been based on little more than habit, or sloth, mutual exploitation, before one is finally overcome, and rejecting everything that gave rise to the inauthentic life.

It's only after these, that one begins to see light at the end of the tunnel.
Through these struggles, one makes one worthy of oneself.

Nietzsche hugged and kissed a horse mistreated by coachman, before collapsing, presumably seeing the horse as an innocent suffering being living the servile life of above.
