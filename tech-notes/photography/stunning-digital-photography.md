### Tips from the book

* Take lots of pictures
* Try different viewpoints
* Travel light
* Learn your camera, learn to use fill flash and bounce flash (flash isn't just for dark spaces)
* Use your pictures, post online, build a portfolio
* Know your final format (how it's going to be used, size, horizontal, vertical, aspect ratio)
* Make a great thumbnail
* Get another opinion
Sometimes a photographer's emotions or focus on the technical details of a picture, like sharpness and contrast, can hinder his or her ability to judge the aesthetics that most non-photographers can just feel.
Outside opinions, no matter where they are from, are valuable.
* Edit (the best of) your images
* Make pictures, don't just take them
  * Envision a photograph, find the best location, find the best viewpoint, find the best time, determine how the natural light needs to be adjusted.
  * Hold the camera up, identify the right exposure, perspective, background blur, depth-of-field, press the shutter
  * Edit the picture.
* Evaluate your photography: experience, planning, camera. Get better gears only after you learn how to plan a shot.
* Don't worry so much about the equipment and settings.
* Get an extra battery and SD card. Never close an empty door: when you have your SD card / battery out, leave the empty door open so you know you are missing something.

"Be there and think": the subject, the location, the perspective, the lighting, the timing, the weather, the mood, the pose, the clothes, the expression, the composition and the camera settings.

"I'd rather you leave your camera in auto mode than become preoccupied with any one aspect of making a picture, especially the equipment and settings."

### Tips from Turkey trip

Before (an important day of) shooting
* Check your lenses. Dirt spots / water stain from last time you should clean?
* Reset your modes. Did you leave it on shutter priority + selfie timer + stabilization off for night photography on a tripod?
* Do your research. If you are depicting a subject, how do you envision its look in your camera? Did you find the best angle and the best time?

During shooting
* Did you intend to have Exposure Compensation at non-0?
* If you want / don't want the DoF effect, did you leave your aperture at a value that doesn't match your desire? Would the background be too blurred? Would part of the subject be blurred given your particular aperture? Do you want that, and do you want to take another with a different aperture? (Similarly, if you want / don't want motion).
* Scan your edges. Are you clipping in / out anything you don't want / want?
* If it's pitch black and you are on aperture priority, does the camera decide to adjust shutter speed too low for hand holding?
* If using a zoom lens, know how the scene will look like given your particular focal length of choice.
* Know how the scene will look like, and how it may turn out different from what your eyes see
  * Dynamic range. Eyes are fantastic with dynamic range, and a digital camera is not. Could the contrast be too big for your camera? Is moving to shades, changing angle, or waiting viable?
  * Undesirable objects. Our eyes see wide and far and do a remarkable (yet subjective!) job of focusing on what you want to see, as opposed to a camera clipping a rectangular scene with all the undesirable objects, all of which get magnified when seen afterwards. Your estimate of their effects on the subject post-shot? Can you move them out of your frame? Would that hurt the composition too much? Could you move / zoom? Would they be easy to get rid of in post processing?
* Are you distracted by minor details and losing sense of the bigger picture? E.g.
  * If you are depicting a person, her facial expression and body language is much more important than if the column in the background is perfectly upright.
  * If you are depicting a flower, the lighting on its petals is more important than whether cutting off the mountain in the background would look aesthetically pleasing or not.
  * If you are depicting an animal, did you capture its eyes, whether its eyes are in focus is more important than avoiding the trash bag in the background.
  * Sure all the details matter, but focus on your subject and master your interaction with it first, before you mind the less important details of a shot.
* Don't clog your picture with too many subjects. Think pigeons on a square.
* If the situation allows, try different angles and settings!
* Did you miss an unique opportunity to depict the scene differently? A flower next to a landmark? Inspect your surroundings, imagine how they will look like on your camera from different angles (lighting, composition, DoF), don't miss the opportunity just because your imagination is limited by constructing the a scene only from an angle our eyes usually see.

After shooting
* Rate and flag more aggressively. Be more assertive about your own work (and maybe in general!). Mark the ones you want to process in the first pass!
* Be proactive / prompt about summarizing what you learn from each.
* Reset your camera settings for tomorrow.

### Composition

What do you want to convey? What is the story you are trying to tell?
What is your subject, and what are some visual cues in the image?

Some things to consider,
* Rule of thirds, try placing your subject at one third towards an edge
* Rule of space, if the subject is moving or looking towards a direction, leave space in that direction such that the picture does not seem crowded
* Focal point, you might see a gorgeous landscape around you, but without a focal point, the picture will come out boring as the eye disregards the scene as background. If you can't find a focal point in a landscape picture, use the sun, ask a friend or yourself to pose. The idea is to try creating an anchor in the image for the eyes to rest upon
* Simplifying / subtraction: did you include anything in the frame that would distract the eyes?
* Angle of view, choose your fore/background, depth of field (lens focal length, f stop, distance to subject, flash). Some things to consider: foreground as a stepping stone to introduce the subject. Or if you want to convey isolation, maybe the foreground would be too much of a distraction.
* Showing scale: you may lose the scale of your subject with too much simplification. If you need to show the scale of your subject, include something of known size.
* Leading lines, they don't have to be straight, towards the subject you want the audience to focus on. What if you don't have them: can you have objects placement that would help cue / balance the image? When a picture has prominent lines, make sure your camera is level. If you want angled lines, make sure it's at least 20-30 degrees off level. 5-degree would just look careless.
* Repeated patterns can leave the impression of something being boundless
* Symmetry, often you need to align the picture perfectly and disregard the rule of thirds
* A flat image (square composition) is often times uninteresting, to show depth, try placing a focal point in front or shooting from an angle. But if you want to convey a stately, formal, and professional attitude, a square composition (with symmetry) might be preferable
* Consider using Dutch angle (a deliberate 15-30 degrees tilt) to convey liveliness, casual and fun. Typically not a good choice for portraits and landscapes.
* Consider combining multiple shots in post-processing for panoramic effect (requires your ae (auto exposure) lock on, and pictures to overlap about one-third)
* Balance and visual weights: subjects in a picture balance by visual weights (size, brightness, color, sharpness, and direction). Compose a visually balanced image.
* Scan the edges of the frame: did you get something you don't want (the camera and our eyes may see things differently, whereas our eyes may filter out the unwanted in an image, the camera would capture them faithfully)? Do your subjects require a little more headroom?
* When shooting black and white, think black and white, focus on the form, texture and composition. Shoot raw, lower the iso. Do it when, e.g. background colors would be distracting.
* Storytelling, mood
* Deliberating breaking the rules

### Lighting

The most amazing subject will be boring when the lighting is bad, and even dull subjects come alive with great lighting.

Every scene has highlights, shadows, and the transitions between them.

**Soft lighting** creates long, smooth transitions between highlights and shadows while **hard lighting** creates sharp transitions.
Hard lighting shows form (3-dimensional, e.g.) and texture, while soft lighting shows shape.

Hard lighting is created by small or faraway light sources while soft lighting is created by large nearby light sources.

Direct sunlight or a bare bulb creates hard lighting, while reflected and diffused light creates soft lighting (e.g. octobox when shooting portraits, or a diffuser before a point light source).
Reflexvive surfaces vs curving shapes, and how they react to light.

Between highlights and shadows are the mid-tones. In soft lighting most of a picture is mid-tones.
Cameras capture mid-tones best. In hard lighting pictures can consist entirely of highlights and shadows with nothing in between. Only the most skilled are able to take great pictures in hard lighting.

The direction of the main light (key light) can change the look of your subject.
Highlights draw attention to features. Shadows diminish and hide features.
Whether photographing person or landscape, choose lighting that highlights the focal point.

* Top lighting gives a natural appearance, but it casts unattractive shadows on faces. Avoid this when shooting portrait.
* Front lighting is better for faces but it removes texture and depth. Flattering for portrait, unideal for architecture and landscape because it removes depth. Your camera's built-in flash creates front lighting.
* Side lighting highlights texture, form and depth and casts long shadows. Side lighting in portraits make pores and blemishes across the face seem exaggerated. 
* Back lighting creates the most dramatic effects but can be challenging to work with. They tend to be all highlights and shadows with few mid-tones. Even worse, the background tends to be highlighted while the foreground in shadows. For portraits, back lighting creates a ring of light around the face that can be very flattering. Similarly for flowers, animals, etc. Backlighting makes your subject silhouette, and forces the viewer to concentrate on shape by eliminating texture, color and form. An ethereal and monochrome style. "Backlighting is one of the rare scenarios that require a good quality lens". Grass and reeds are a good choice for subjects.

Your environment interacts with light. All light is hard when it leaves its source; your environment softens and diffuses it.
If you want to reduce the amount of reflected light, put a polarizing filter on your lens.

* Golden, sun being low, right after sunrise or before sunset. More directional, and soft. Think landscape with hills and textures upon which shadows are cast. Light and shadow, depth and drama. Clouds have similar effect: part of the scene are lit. Warm golden glow. During golden hours sky is also typically less hazy, making your pictures sharper and creating better contrasts. Important for shooting fall colors. For landscape photography, plan your trip around golden hours. Check out www.photoephemeris.com and google earth, toggle time and plan your shot.
* Blue, right before sunrise or after sunset. Sun's below the horizon, light's reflected from the atmosphere, taking away contrast and evenly lit. Ambient, soft. Narrow time frame. 
* Flat, generally poor for landscape: not much contrast, depth. Overcast flat light can work in particular cases, e.g. with overcast cloud, on waterfalls. Consider desaturating, black and white to bring out the texture / mood of the scene.

* Flash
  * Fill flash. Say you are shooting a model in daylight under an overcast sky, and want to reduce shadows from the eyes / face by adding a front lighting. Control flash output using flash exposure compensation (try aperture priority or shutter priority with this).
  * Bounce flash. Attaching an external flash to change the angle of lighting, or have lighting bounce off a wall. This wouldn't work outside without bouncing your flash off a reflector. (requires low, white ceilings). Broad lighting (main light closer to the side of face closer to the camera), short lighting.
  * High speed sync option. Motion with flash.

Proper catchlight (light reflected from the eyes, ideally, above the center of the pupils) is critical to portrait and wildlife photography.

As long as your eyes are open, you can study light and shadow.

* Color temperature, white balance
  * Different light sources, e.g. candles, sunrise, moonlight, daylight / flash (warm --> cold), have different color temperatures.
  * Lower color temperature are considered warm, as they cast an orange light.
  * Cameras may apply auto white balancing, which may be off (think multiple light sources with different temperatures, e.g. camera flash and a lantern, in which case you might want to apply orange gels to your flash). White balance can be adjusted in postprocessing. Our eyes apply auto white balancing as well, which causes lights warm or cold often mis-appear as white to our eyes.

### Camera control

* Focal plane; focusing modes
* Back button focus (avoid switching between AFS / AFC / MF through menu); focus traps; precise focusing using live view
* Shutter speed
* iso, dynamic range, exposure compensation, histogram, metering modes

### Troubleshooting

Blurry pictures
* Depth of field
* Autofocus picked the wrong spot / multiple spots
* Could be image stabilization not set-up correctly (turn image stabilization off when on a tripod, if it doesn't turn off automatically); or using full frame lenses on aps-c sensors
* Subject motion blur
* Picking the sharpest aperture: the primary concern is DoF, but know that most cameras are sharpest when two stops higher than wide open
* Air quality (the more humid, the more air distorts light in its transmission)
* Lens quality
* Soft light: subjects in hard light are sharper
* Be sure to use a single auto focus point, take lots of pictures, refocus often, and choose the sharpest

Noise
* lower iso, lightroom / photoshop (where you can reduce noise in selected areas of the image, as noise reduction on the full image also tends to lose details)

Bad color
* white balance issues when lights of multiple color temperatures are present
* lightroom white balance selector works by letting pick a pixel that is truly white, and adjust based on that

Spots in picture / dust on sensor

Washed out pictures
* Low contrast: histogram peaks around one area in the middle, instead of distributed throughout the dynamic range

Battery

Flash sync

### Portraits

* The subject of a portrait is rarely the entire person, but instead their facial expression, and you should consider cropping around the face.
* Your focus is usually the eyes; make sure eyes are well lit, ideally a catch light to ten or two o'clock should show
* Rembrandt lighting: side lighting with bounce flash so that a triangle under the subject's eye is lit (on the shadowy side of face)
* Tilted shoulder: narrower body; generally preferable at an angle
* Head turn: direct (business headshots, eye contact), seven-eighth (nose to the side to appear smaller; both ears visible; usually looks better with men), three quarters (nose not crossing the cheek to appear smaller, accentuating cheekbones; gives more depth to the face; usually looks better with women), profile (face to one side, rarely flattering; shows character)
* Head tilt: chin tilted up, head tilt towards the lower (farther) shoulder, ear a little to the back, masculine; chin a little bit down, head tilt towards the higher shoulder, feminine
* Mouth
* Hair light / bounce flash (hard lighting to reflect off of the subject's hair; to bring out (especially dark) hair from the background; consider a little fan to add movement to hair; be careful when lighting white or grey hair. Fly-aways: make sure no stray hairs cover the face, they are difficult for post processing.)
* Arms, hands
* Group shots; deeper DoF (so use simple backgrounds), fill the frame with faces, 

### Example subjects

* Still life photography: arrangements / composition; choosing props: symbolism, interaction with light. Good practice for theories.
* Levitation photography, editting trick
* Multiple exposures, silhouette one picture on (the dark portrait in) another

# Adobe Lightroom

* Exposure, exposure compensation on camera
* Adjusting highlights down can sharpen the details
* Shadow
* White and black clips the histogram
* Vibrance, saturation can bring out the color
* Noise reduction, sharpening
* Sensor dust (spot removal)
* Copy settings to other pictures

* Wildlife / portrait, if you didn't catch the eye, you didn't take the shot
