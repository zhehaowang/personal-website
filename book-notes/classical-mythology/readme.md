Hesiod Theogony, Work and Days

Chaos
Gaia, Tartarus, Eros, Erebus, Hemera, Nyx
Uranus - Gaia
Cronus - Rhea
Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter

Hestia is rarely mentioned in literature, almost negligible in mythology, but presumably very important in religion.

Zeus - Hera
Ares (whom everyone hates), Enyo, Hebe, Eileithyia (childbirth), Eris (discord), Hephaestus (Hera by herself)

Zeus - Metis (wisdom)
Athena (from Zeus's head. Zeus swallows Metis who gave birth to Athena inside Zeus. Metis's son is prophecied to overthrow Zeus. One of the rare cases where gods / mortals cheat fate. Greeks believed thoughts / wisdom comes from the torso, and Metis gave counsel to Zeus from inside his belly.)

In men's meeting with gods at Mecone to decide sacrifice, Prometheus tried to trick Zeus into picking the pile of bones covered by meat and fat as sacrifice, and leaving the pile of meat covered by bones and unedible parts to human. Zeus knew and decided to punish Prometheus by punishing men, and took fire from them.
Prometheus later stole fire and gave it back to men, for which act he was chained to a pillar and have his liver grown everyday to be eaten by an eagle. Zeus punished men, too, for Prometheus stealing fire, by giving men the first woman, named Pandora in Work and Days.
Heracles rescued Prometheus from the chain.

While these are from Theogony, many anecdotes / stories we hear today are actually from Ovid's metamorphoses.

Demeter, Persephone, the Eleusinian Mysteries, seasons, and Greek view of life and death.

Persephone's abduction by Hades and splitting her time in the underworld vs mount Olympus resulted in the seasons where one third of the year crops don't grow.
As told by the Homeric hymn on Demeter (Homeric in time and style but not by Homer), during Demeter's search for Persephone, she visited Eleusis disguised as a crone and babysitted the queen's son, whom she intended to bring to immortality by annoiting and throwing into the fire. The plan was foiled by the queen who happened upon the ritual, angering Demeter and causing the death of the prince.
The Eleusinian Mysteries were a cult ritual dedicated to Demeter in which only the initiated were told of the rituals. Our view of what the ritual is about preserved from those of the potentially biased early Christian authors. Presumably symbolisms of life and death.

While the Greek view of afterlife is in general pretty grim: most men became shadows / images in the grim world of tartarus, except extraordinary souls or terrible sinners (e.g. tantalus who intended to trick the gods into eating flesh by serving his own son, whose shoulder only Demeter ate mistakenly, resulting in an ivory shoulder when the gods bring the son back); the Eleusinian Mysteries might have offered a brighter view.
Note that the general grim view differs from traditional belief of Christianity or Islam, in that the latter believes the afterlife / the eternal is the important part and the deeds of this life would affect that of the afterlife, while the former places its emphasis on this life and rarely consequences of one's deeds in this life.

Orphism is another cult dealing with life and death. The teaching of the mortal Orpheus (who, surprisingly some sources claim, is the child of Apollo and a muse) while in the underworld trying to bring back his dead wife Eurydice. Persuaded by his superb music, Hades and Persephone gave their consent on the condition that Orpheus does not look back when leading Eurydice out of the underworld, which he failed to do.
Reincarnation might have been a central concept in Orphism, which took a view like that of Buddhism, that reincarnation / cycle-after-cycle is something one wants to escape from, and one does it by saying certain things to certain gods in the underworld.


Apollo and Artemis
Children of Zeus and Leto (who is of little mythological importance otherwise)
Apollo him of medicine and plague, youth and sudden death (struck by the arrow of Apollo), all the creative arts (administers over the Muses), rationality, prophesy (delegated by Zeus), and later on associated with the Sun.
