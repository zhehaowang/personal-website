# Fooled by randomness

### Part I

Luck is often mistaken for skills, probability mistaken for certainty.

Croesus wanted to impress Solon with his fortune, and asked Solon who the happiest man is.
Solon suggested one who lived a noble life and died in battle. Reason being.

"You asked me a question concerning a condition of humankind â€” happiness. I reckon 70 years to be a long life. Of those 26,250 days, no two will be the same. We are wholly accident. Good fortune is always mixed with misery. In the journey of our lives there is an infinity of twists and turns, and the weather can change from calm to whirlwind in an instant. We can never know what might come next. The gods are jealous and like to mess with mortals. Sometimes we get a glimpse of happiness, and then are plunged into ruin. Yes you are fortunate, wonderfully rich, lord of many peoples. But with respect to the question you asked, I have no answer, until I hear that you have closed your life happily."

Monte carlo, random process, alternate history. "Why me"?

It is not natural for us to learn from history.

Hindsight bias.

Over a short time increment, one observes the variability of the portfolio, not the returns.

A trader made money does not mean he is good.
Similarly, passing a particular interview does not mean you are good.
Our emotions may not be designed to understand such points.
Reversed causality and bias.

Ultimately news / media is an entertainment industry.

We often mistake probability for expectation: high chance of market going up does not mean you should long, if in the rare case of it going down, it's going down by a lot.
This asymmetry / skewness is often times counterintuitive, considering that we are used to symmetric bell curves in everyday lives.

Consider this, is market statistics even stationary (as we observe, the distribution itself may shift).
Can past data be used to forecast future performance?

Consider this statement: "I have just completed a thorough statistical analysis of the life of president Bush. For fifty-eight years, close to 21000 observations, he did not die once. I can hence pronounce him as immortal, with a high degree of statisical significance."
Rare events do happen. If the past, by bringing surprises, did not resemble the past previous to it, then why should our future resemble our current past?

Extreme empiricism, competitiveness, and an absence of logical structure to one's inference can be quite a explosive combination.

A scientific hypothesis is falsifiable. Newton's Laws are science, and falsified; astrology is not, as it's not falsifiable.
Karl Popper would claim there are only two types of theories, those that are known to be wrong (falsified), and those that have yet been known to be wrong.

### Part II

Survivorship bias.
