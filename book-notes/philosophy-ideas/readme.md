# The Great Ideas of Philosophy

Questions of **Knowledge**, **Conduct**, and **Governance**.

### Did the Greeks invent it all

What differentiates the works of Pythagoras, Plato, etc from those of Homer, Sophocles, Confucius, Buddha etc?

In philosophy there is a **critical, disinterested skepticism**, towards the principles we hold, and even mandates of God.
The pursuit would be **wisdom itself**, not wisdom for the sake of something else.
And a philosophical realization made through skeptical analysis and debates would not end with an exclamation mark, but with semicolon.

The Greek civilization of 6 Century BC would not have been more powerful than the Egyptians or Persians, yet the latter were not considered to have laid the foundations of Western civilization.
How developed the thoughts are of a people / country / culture does not necessarily reflect how wealthy / powerful the group is (their ability to solve practical problems and influence others).
Nor would philosophy be the product of a leisurely Hellenistic upper class built upon labor of slaves and indentured servants.
Egyptians and Persians would have been better suited in that regard.

Greek religion tends to have an estrangement: Gods are revered but aloof and indifferent towards our matters.
The fundamental questions of being would not be something you consult the Oracle for, but rather left to reason about by ourselves.
We ourselves need to make order (classification) out of the chaos of this world.
The state would be religious but without a state religion.

Imagine us as puppets made by the Gods with various cords in it, these cords, reflecting pleasure, pain and emotions pull us in different directions.
One cord is sacred and golden, that of reason and calculations. And when one follows this cord, one is virtuous.

(Plato, The Laws)

### Pythagoras and the divinity of number

Abstract transcendance philosophy (vs natural philosophy would be the focus of later Greek / Aristotle philosophy).

Pythagoras, rich family, shrouded in mystery.
Learnt maths (fractions, calendar predicting Nile flood) from his Egyptian travels.
Rumor has it he traveled and taught in Babylon / India.
Spent most of his life traveling, came back to Greece as a governor and founded his sect.
Pythagoras did poorly as a governor. A philosophically-guided state may not be well suited to the brutal reality.

**Cynics** are an important Pre-Socratic philosophical school. Diogenes. Nothing too excess.

**Pythagoreanism**: abstract idea is the ultimate creator of material and physical realities, and that idea is numbers, hence divinity of numbers, in particular 1 (point), 2 (line), 3 (plane), 4 (solid, tetrahedron, special place in Pythagorean teaching), sum is 10, also sacred in Pythagoreanism.
The lawfulness with which we enter social life is based off of numbers.

Also known for his theorem on right angle triangle and (himself / his school's) contribution to discovery of harmonic structure of music (harmony, matches with something in the soul; what creates a harmony is the relationship between notes) (part of the intended design of the cosmos).

Over time we won't exist but rectilinear triangle will, mathematical abstractions will, and will remain correct, precise in describing the relationships in physical world.

Also believes in transmigration of souls, death liberates something in us.

Pi, e, sqrt(-1) has no place in Pythagoreanism?

Sophia, wisdom itself; and Pythagoras considered himself a philosopher, as he strived to and have befriended wisdom itself.

Elegance and simplicity expressed in mathematical, formulaic equation.

### What is there

A metaphysical question.

Real object, perception and distortion, what is beyond there.

If our senses (always) lie, how would we know reality.

Aristotle notes that they have just completed a systematic consideration of nature / the physical world, and what is natural.

Centuries later people notes his work after the physics treatise as metaphysics: after the physics / natural science work.

**Metaphysics** deals with the subject of real existence.
* What is there: **ontology** (being, the branch of metaphysics that deals with reality and existence. After change, does the original still exist? Cause and effect. Are there minds and thoughts, or just peculiar states of the brain, are they merely terms hankering to superstitution? Does what really exists vary being by being i.e. sensory apparatus? What sort of being am I? What am I made of, made for?)
* Our modes of knowing: **epistemology**. Epistemological (systematic, organization and principle of facts) questions: are senses wrong? If so, what is right? Abstract rationality of Pythagoras? Customs? Religion? Epistemology is the study, criticism and refinements of our modes of knowing. Epistemic justification.

Is there heaven? Is there such a thing as goodness? Is there a moral reality and objectivity? Is there real beauty? Is there truth? Is there right or wrong?

The conclusion we reach is more or less based on the method we choose, often times blindly, by habit, social condition or conventional wisdom.
There tends to be a vicious circularity, between the claim (ontology) and the methods (epistemology).

Certainly the harmony and balance Greek perceived as beautiful, is not the same as what medieval artists found beautiful in their depiction of human form.
Yet the Greeks philosophers were unaware of the shifting.

**Democritus**: ultimate reality is but an incredibly large of atoms. Atoms and the space in between (the void).
Everything is ultimately reducible to that level. What we see as flowers, buildings, animals are but ephemeral, different in atomic composition.
The soul is a finer kind of atomics structure.

Earth, air, fire and water.

Can we even answer the ontological questions? Beautiful or ugly? True or false? Moral or not?

**Heraclitus**: "no one descends twice in the same river". Sees nothing but flux and change.

**Protagoras**: pre-Socratic. Founding father of **Sophist** thought.
"Man is the measure of all things."
Judgment of any form, must have some grounding, and that grounding can only be the experiences of a lifetime, we cannot take an epistemological position external to our own human ways of thought and feeling.
If there is a standard independent of human nature, we cannot even comprehend it.

Hence, is pursuing truth a misguided objective? Each person is the measure of all things. Truth is subjective. We are not equipped to comprehend it, even if there might be objective.

About the gods, I cannot say if they are or how they are constituted in shape, the unclarity of the subject and the shortness of human lives.
I can write you about what I see and hear and touch, but I cannot write you about the gods.

**Socrates** spends much of his work disputing the Sophists: much can be questioned about the claim.
Each man not only is not the measure of all things, we are generally very poor in understanding ourselves.
With him philosophy becomes a humanizing and humanistic enterprise (the human condition), from which there is no retreat.

### Greek tragedian on men's fate

Dance is important in Homer, Ovid and other classical authors. Dance of cranes Theseus.

Chorus + Dance + Participants and preliterate history and moral thought.

Out of possibility of drama comes the dispute and dialogue.
Philosophy may have come from cultural activities such as drama.
The thought refining itself.

The human condition as understood by the dramatists.
Is Medea a murderess, or are her motives irresistable? (Her sorcery practices are of Chthonic and pre-Olympian. When we surrender reason to passion, chaos ensues.)
What about the trial of Orestes?
The debate on Nomos (norm, natural law). Antigone. Is the law of kings higher, or the nature that sisters should bury brothers?

Euripides heroic characters are very much human.
At the end of day, character is destiny.

Aristotle's view on women, vs that of Greek tragedians.
Aristotle's view on tragedy: bad things happening to good people.

If there's an all seeing and all loving god, why such evil and injustice around us?

### Herodotus and history

Herodotus's Histories attributes war to irreconcilable differences in value.
Legions are moved with words and symbols.

Histories describes various people's dress, weapon, food, economonies and religious belief, to give a full perspective on events of historical significance, as opposed to mythology where such accounts on humanistic details are often glossed over.

Herodotus would suggest to account for events of historical significance, perspectives on sociology, pyschology beyond mere chronology is required.
And his teaching, or that of history, would be meaningful beyond ethnicity, and calls onto the roots of humanity itself.

Histories has clear distinctions for Herodotus's own opinions, opinions he has heard and facts.

His work, however, has many inaccurate accounts to establish some morals on the question of conduct. E.g. the emblematic meeting between Croesus and Solon, where the happiest men are established to be Kleobis and Biton, two sons who yoked themselves to their mother's cart, such that their mother, a priestess, would not be late for the festival of Hera.
They died peacefully after the deed.
Solon would claim only after one's story is complete can one be judged whether their lives being happy or not, and human happiness is not dependent on wealth.
